# Assign tasks automatically:
Google Sheets + Worksheet

**We continue to introduce you to the possibilities of[direct integration with
Zapier](https://worksection.com/en/blog/zapier-update.html).** Today, we're
going to take a closer look at how you can **automate the process of setting
tasks** from Google Sheets in Worksection. First, let's tell you a little bit
about [Zapier.](https://zapier.com/)

## About Zapier

**Zapier** connects different online platforms through automated processes (or
"zaps"), allowing data to be exchanged between them.

  

**In this way, Zapier makes it possible to set up automated actions
in[Worksection,](https://worksection.com/en/)** reducing a complex process to
a few simple steps. This makes it much easier to manage everyday tasks,
automating them and freeing up time for more important things.

_  
_

**_Let's get down to business and set up automation between Google Sheets and
Worksection._**

## **Google Sheets + Worksection**

We have prepared a practical case for you, where we will set up and test the
automation, that is, the process of automatically creating a task in the
workspace system when filling in a row in the corresponding Google Sheets
table.

### Setting up a trigger

We select **_" New Spreadsheet Row in Google Sheets"_** as the trigger. By
doing so, filling in a row in the selected Google Sheets worksheet will
trigger an action in the Worksection account.

#### Adding a sheet

To add the required worksheet, you must first **_log in to your Google
account._** Then, in the _**" Trigger"**_ tab, select the required sheet in
the specified table.

​Then let the sys­tem **_test the trig­ger,_** and you’re ready to move on to
the next stage.​

### Action settings

We select **_" Create task in project"_** as the action:

**_After the authorization stage in Worksection,_** you need to enter data to
automatically fill in the task with data from the table.

###### In this article, we will give you an example of how to fill in the
fields. When setting up your own automation, you will have the opportunity to
customize it to your own needs.

  

You can either enter text manually or paste the relevant cells from Google
Sheets, which will be **automatically integrated** into the task once they are
filled in.

  

#### _We have prepared a detailed video tutorial to help you set up the
automation process. So, to learn more about the algorithm, please,[check out

## What is the use of such automation?

**The possibilities for use are limited only by your business needs.** Zapier
serves as a reliable assistant to which you can transfer routine tasks,
effectively freeing up time for more important things.

  

**_In particular, Google Sheets + Worksection automation helps with:_**

### Resource planning for the project manager

#### [The case]

​A project manager at a large IT company is responsible for allocating
resources across numerous projects. Given the varying scope and needs of
different projects, it is necessary to balance the workload of the team while
ensuring that the projects get completed.

  

**Automation:** Use Zapier to create an automated process that automatically
creates tasks in Worksection when information is added to Google Sheets. The
Zapier configuration works by creating a corresponding task in Worksection for
each project listed in the spreadsheet, with details on resources, priority,
and timing.

### Tracking the delivery of orders to the client

#### [The case]

A small online store that is just getting started can use automation with
Google Sheets to keep track of new orders. Each row in the spreadsheet
contains order details. These include customer name, email, product list, and
order date.

  

**Automation:** When an employee adds a new row to the spreadsheet, Zapier
automatically creates a new task in Worksection to process the order, where
the team can track the status of the product's processing, shipping, and
delivery.

### Marketing campaign planning

#### [The case]

The marketing department is planning campaigns and is using Google Sheets to
assign tasks, set due dates, and identify owners.

  

**Automation:** Filling in a row in a spreadsheet with information about a new
task within the company automatically creates a task in Worksection in the
corresponding project.

## To summarize

 _**So far,** we've successfully showcased the integration capabilities of
Worksection and Zapier using Google Sheets as an example of easy automation.
This information is intended to help you improve your project management
skills, organize your workflow more efficiently, and contribute to the
progress of your business.​_​​​​​​​​​​​
