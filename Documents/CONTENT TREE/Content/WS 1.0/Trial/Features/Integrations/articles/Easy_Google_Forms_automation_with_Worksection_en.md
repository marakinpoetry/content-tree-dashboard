# Easy Google Forms 
automation with Worksection

**You've already learned about the possibility of[direct integration with
Zapier.](https://worksection.com/en/blog/zapier-update.html) **So we decided
to go further and tell you more about its capabilities.

  

This article is the start of a series of materials on **the setup of
automation,** with using Google services as an example. Before we start, let's
remember what [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) is.

## Briefly about Zapier

**Zapier is** a tool that connects actions in different services in "zaps"
(automated processes). **This greatly simplifies your workflow** by allowing
you to synchronize everyday tasks between services.

  

With Zapier, you can set up a series of automated actions **without the need
to write code** or develop complex integration solutions. Zapier simplifies
this process to just a few clicks. This makes using your favorite services
with [Worksection](https://worksection.com/en/) much easier and more
efficient.

  

** _Now let's move on to the practical part and set up Google Forms automation
with Worksection._**

## Google Forms + Worksection

To illustrate, we will explore the automation settings through a specific
example, namely creating a new task in Worksection when filling out a Google
Forms questionnaire to process customer requests. So let's start with the
configuration itself:

### Setting up a trigger

For the trigger, we select the **_" New form response in Google Forms"
_**action, which means that filling out the form you provided will trigger an
action in Worksection.

#### How to add a form?

Once you have selected an action, the next step is to **_log in to your Google
Account._** The next step is to select the form you need in the
**_“Trigger”_** tab. The form must have been created in your Google Forms
account.

Then let the system **_test the trigger,_** and you're ready to move on to the
next stage.

### Action settings

As an action, we choose **_" Create task in project":_**

  

![](/images/upload/Zapier_google_forms_3_1.@x1_2.png)  

The next step is **_to log in to Worksection_** and then go to the automatic
task creation settings. Here, you can customize the task information to suit
your needs.

###### This is an example of how to use automatic data entry. When you create
an automation yourself, you can choose the appropriate configuration for your
processes.

  

You can either enter text manually or add a tag with the answer to a question
from a Google form, which will be automatically pulled into the task when
filled in.

#### _We have also prepared a detailed video tutorial with the algorithm for
creating an automation. This is available by[following the
link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn30kQiJgbo) to the video  
on our YouTube channel ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/1f3a5.png)_

## What will the functionality be useful for?

**There are many use cases.** It all depends on the specific needs of your
business. Zapier can be a useful assistant for you, to whom you can easily
delegate repetitive, template-based tasks, which will help you optimize your
working time with greater efficiency.

  

** _Here are some more ideas of what you can use Google Forms + Worksection
automation for:_**

  * **Collecting and storing feedback at the end of the project** ​​​​

Once the project is complete, use Google Forms to collect feedback. The data
can be **automatically imported into Worksection using Zapier.** Then this
information can be used to analyze customer satisfaction and plan further
improvements.

  * **Improving internal communication** ​​​​

Automation will help simplify the collection of internal information, such as
vacation requests or ideas for improving workflows, from the team. Responses
are**easily transformed into tasks for discussion and control** within
Worksection, ensuring organized processing and feedback.

  * **Setting tasks for fixing service bugs​** ​​​

Google Forms automation will be a convenient solution for creating tasks in
Worksection with development requests for the technical department. In this
way, a non-technical specialist will **automatically generate a correct
technical task in the system** for programmers after filling out the form.

  * **Optimize job application processing​** ​​

The automation process can **simplify the processing of job inquiries,**
applications, or other HR tasks, ensuring efficient management of resources
and candidates.

  * **Inventory or resource management​**

If your company sells products, Google Forms can be used to collect orders and
restocking notices, and**Zapier can automatically create tasks** for the
appropriate people in your organization.

## To sum up

 _**Today,** we've already explored direct integration between Worksection and
Zapier, using simple automation with Google Forms as an example. The aim of
this material is to expand your project management potential and optimize this
process for maximum business development benefit. _​​​​​​​​​​​​
