# Tasks and Gantt chart

**Hello, WS friends!** We are continuing to talk about the new features...

  

## Tasks and communication

Earlier on the following pages — **Tasks** / **By people** — you could see a
complete list of tasks (open + closed) or only the list of the open tasks
(without the closed ones). And if you needed the information on what was
closed on a certain day, week, or month, then you could only check it in the
Reports section or with the help of the advanced filter ...

Now not only can you switch to viewing all [Open], but also to all the
[Closed] [1] ones, as well as indicate the period of time that interests you
[2].

![](/images/upload/1._Zakrytye_za_nedelju.png)  

For example, in the tasks By People, you can choose only [Closed] > [by week],
and see who did what right away as well as check whether a certain employee
managed to stay within the estimates limit and whether he or she exceeded the
budget and to which degree...

## Tasks

At first glance, nothing changed, but this is far from the truth...

  

![](/images/upload/3._Zadachy_y_obshchenye_umenshen_razmer__1.png)  

  

[1] — Updated filters panel with enabled Hint [F1]

[2] — In the «tasks and subtasks» section, now there is an option of
expanding/ collapsing a task. The tick remembers its state, which is common
with the Gantt chart

[3] — Added icon-status “Seen by Executive”

[4] — Now in any view, “Tasks Only” or “Tasks and Subtasks”, there is an
option where you can simultaneously choose both tasks and subtasks for the
following bulk operations

**Lower statistics block**

{NEW} Now the costs statistics is automatically recalculated when searching or
applying filters.

![](/images/upload/4._Zadachy_y_obshchenye_bary_umenshen_.png)  

[1] — Progress bar now has a number for the burning tasks with the transition
to the filtered list.

[2] — Overall pie chart of project costs is added

 _This is the progress from the project’s card that can be seen on the View
page. Now the data of the estimates versus actual costs by a project is always
available here._

## Tasks by People

![](/images/upload/5._Po_ljudjam_s_klavyshamy_umenshen_.png)  

  

[1] — Contextual search is now looking for tasks by default, and if you need
to find an executive, then use @ and first letters of the name or last name

[2] — On the filters panel, there is a filter **Me** added that should have
been familiar to you by now.

[3] — Now you can edit labels and time frames on the fly without leaving the
page. Now you can see all the labels and statuses in their full size. However,
if you have too many labels which interferes with the view – you can hide them
and leave only statuses [View] > [Only statuses]

[4] — Indicator of costs availability is added — square time clock next to the
task’s name. When exceeded, it becomes red. Also, there is now an option of
filtering lists of tasks by costs.

[5] — Now there’s Hint added, which can be closed and opened again by clicking
[F1]

{And now is the most exciting part!}

### Transferring tasks in between projects participants

![](/images/upload/6._Pretaskyvaem_zadachu_umenshen_.png)  

  

You can grab a «line» and drag it to the card of another project participant —
thus reassigning the task [1].

There are two “technical cards” on the page — Any employee and Without an
Executive [2].  
This allows to take up on tasks that have not been assigned to anyone yet and
assign executives to them. Or, on the contrary, unassign executives from a
project and transfer those projects to these cards.

When there are many tasks and participants, the whole page can take up several
screens, which is, in our humble opinion, not quite convenient. That is why
now when you grab a task, there pops up a «dock» with the employees’ avatars
to whom a certain task can be assigned [3].

For example, if you grabbed an open task, then avatars only of those people
who can see it can be assigned as a new executive.

If you do not really like to drag anything, then you can always mark several
tasks at the bottom and, as earlier, use bulk operations that are not limited
just to reassigning.

  * _All the changes in the executives dragging/ reassigning need to be SAVED!_

  * _On pages with 1000 and more tasks, dragging is automatically deactivated._

**Please, take a look at the updated VIEW menu**

**![](/images/upload/7._Vyd_1.png)  
**

  * {new}_Open / Closed / All_[1]
  * {new}  _Show / Hide participants’ cards who do not have tasks_[2]
  * {new}  _Show / Hide labels_[3]

Important! Only open tasks can be dragged! Backdating change of an executive
and the date of completion of the finished tasks can only be done in the
Reports section.

## Copying and Task transferring

{new} Now any user can copy a task provided that this user can set tasks. And
transferring the tasks can be done not only by an administrator but also by an
author.

**Transferring is combined with the change of hierarchy**

There is no longer the need to do one thing (change hierarchy), and then
another one (copying). Now, right when copying and transferring you can turn
subtasks into tasks and vice versa. The task being copied will become a Task
or Subtask depending on the level of the hierarchy you put it in.

![](/images/upload/8._Perenos_yly_kopyrovanye.png)  

  * [1]_— can make a Task when transferring_
  * [2]_— can be included in a subtask and turned into a sub-subtask_
  * [3]_— or you can choose another project and do the very same thing in there_
  * [4]_— when there are many tasks, it is helpful to use search_

Please, note: with a shortage of nesting levels, subtasks are carried to a
higher level with the prefix of its former parent.

{And now meet the long-awaited option}

### Option to copy connections and restore the length of tasks!

For this, during the second step, turn on Copying with all the «Time frames
and connections» [1] set a new date of start [2]. The starting point is the
start of the earliest task in the group to be copied.

![](/images/upload/9._Svjaz_5.png)  

All this allows you to accurately restore the structure and duration of
communications tasks, but with the new date specified by you.

![](/images/upload/10._Hant_svjaz.gif)  

_Even with accounting for or omitting the weekends and holidays option  
(when they are tuned off and a five-day week is used)._

## Detailed view of a task

### Change the name of a task on the spot

Now there is a long-awaited option to quickly change the name of the task.
This can be done directly in the detailed view. Just click on the title.

  
![](/images/upload/11._Pereymenovat_nazvanye.png)

  

_(provided that you have enough permissions for editing the task)_

_![](/images/upload/12._Zatraty_v_podzadache.png)  
_

[1]**Reassigning, change of time frames and labels on the fly**. All the
existing symbols are clickable.

{Tip} If you want to hide Labels in this column and leave only Statuses, do it
on the Tasks by People page [View] > [Only statuses], and it will be inherited
in here.

[2]**Drag-n-drop** of open tasks is possible anywhere in the task’s block –
there is no longer a need to look for a special area that can be grabbed and
dragged. Please, note! Dragging function is unlimited only with manual
sorting. In other sorting options, drag-n-drop works only for the change of
hierarchy.

[3]**Costs indicator is added.** Hint will show the numbers, and click will
open a window with details.

{New} Changing or setting the estimates is now possible right from the window
for costs entering.

![](/images/upload/13._Vnosym_predpolahaemye.png)  

## Gantt chart

Now there are no margins on the right, left, and at the bottom. Thanks to
that, the chart has more space now. It is always bad when there are two scroll
bars. We got rid of the horizontal one having changed it to «press and drag»
one. Simply hold down the left mouse button on the chart grid and slide it in
any direction. Legend is now combined with a Hint and is accessed by pressing
[F1] or through the menu.

![](/images/upload/14._Hant_umenshen_.png)  

  

[1] — An option is added to collapse a task that remembers its state now! Its
state (expanded/ collapsed) is common with the task’s page.

[2] — Avatars without the names leave more space for the task’s name.

[3] — [View] Now you can Show tasks outside of the screen {new}, which means
that when shifting the grid to the left and to the right, there will be no
jumps, and all the tasks will remain at their spots.

### Gantt by People *

On the Gantt Chart by All Projects, now there is also an option By People. It
allows for planning the resources of bigger teams and build inter-project
connections. By clicking on an avatar, you can reassign tasks in between the
employees, and then change their timeframe taking into account the workload of
the executive.

*_available only in the PRO level plans._

##  
Calendar

  

![](/images/upload/15._Kalendar_umenshen__1.png)  

  

[1] — No need to look for that special area that can be grabbed

[2] — Now there is a gradient highlighting of the Start events

[3] — Transferred events stay dark till they are saved

[4] — Syncing of the calendar and Hint with the Legend are now available from
the menu

## Other

An option to [Set a task] right from the user’s card [1]. When you know for
whom to set a task, it is enough to find and click that person’s picture in
the comments feed, in the participants block or subscribers. Here is also an
option to [Subscribe / Unsubscribe] [2].

![](/images/upload/16._Kartochka.png)  

{And the last but not the least ;-) } An option to URGENTLY limit the block
and the feeds events to events from your correspondence. It is accessible both
for the Main Page and for the View.

_Dear friends, that is all. As always, we are looking forward_

 _to your feedback and new suggestions._
