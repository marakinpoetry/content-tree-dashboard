# Use Worksection to the fullest. Part 1: 
System settings, Bulk actions, 
Templates

###### _**How to get the most out of Worksection?** In this article, we'll
show you some non-obvious tricks that will come in handy when using the system
on a daily basis and save you time._

## System configuration options

You can **personalize** your experience by using the Worksection settings.
Let's take a look at some of the **interesting features** that you can use to
customize the service usage.

### In this article, we will take a closer look at:

  * Set up your account and profile​
  * Bulk actions in the system and work with templates​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

* * *

​

## Set up your account and profile

Let's start with the basics:**system account and profile settings.**

### [Account settings]

**The Account Owner and Account Administrators** have access to the company's
account settings. In addition to the standard account settings, there are a
**number of interesting settings available:**

**  
**

  * **Project managers have control over project participants.** This allows the project manager to add or remove participants within the project to which he or she is assigned as a leader.
  * **Enable team visibility.** You can prevent teams from seeing each other if you want to keep them separate. This way you ensure each team works autonomously.
  * **Permission to invite a guest to subtasks.**
  * **Permission to see hidden information.** This option allows administrators of a specific team or department to view hidden information. If the account has restricted access, only users assigned to such tasks will be able to view hidden information. 
  * **Lists by first/last name/nickname.** Set up the choice of what (first name, last name or nickname) is used to create lists in the system.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

* * *

### [Profile settings]

**Every user in the system** has access to these settings. This is where **you
can fill in** your contact details, set up your work schedule and set up a
notification system:

  

![](/images/upload/Settings_3_eng.@x1.png)  

  * **Integrate with Telegram or Viber** if you want to receive notifications directly on one of the messengers.
  * **Set up notifications between channels:** where and what notifications you want to receive.
  * **Morning digest.** A feature that allows you to receive a morning email notification with the most relevant tasks for you. You can configure it in this menu.

* * *

### ​[Team settings]

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**If you have to work with teams from different regions,** you can set a
separate interface language for each.

  

To do this, **go to the team settings** and select the required language. You
can also add **your logo and other contact details to the team.**

### [Dashboard settings]

**The dashboard contains important information** about the progress of the
project:**  

  * project speed;
  * employee activity;
  * number of closed/open tasks, etc. 

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​**

**Dashboard blocks are clickable,** allowing you to learn more about the
information.

  

![](/images/upload/Dashbord_kh1.@x1.gif)  

**Customizing the placement of dashboard blocks** is a less obvious function
of this section:

  

![](/images/upload/Zmina_blokiv_kh1.@x1.gif)  

This allows you to organize your dashboard data by relevance.

* * *

### [Setting up the main page]

The main page displays **all available information about the projects** you
are participating in. You can also:

#### Setting up the display of data by task

The main page shows **all tasks by default.** However, you can personalize the
information for more focused work with the help of the **“Customize feed”**
settings.

  

![](/images/upload/Settings_7_eng.@x1.png)  

#### Project display

You can use the filter to view projects in a more convenient way. You can also
use the filter to view **the project history.** This is where all the data on
completed projects and tasks within them is stored.

  

![](/images/upload/Filtry_projektiv_kh1.@x1.gif)  

* * *

### [Project settings and description]

You can add a Project Description, Stages and Labels to describe project
information in more detail.

  

![](https://worksection.com/images/upload/Statusy_ta_mitky_projektu_kh1.@x1.gif)

  

The requirements for creating tasks and the general algorithm for working
within the project **can be specified in the description.** In the project
settings, you can also **choose a color for the project.** This allows you to
further differentiate between the company's work areas.

**Select the most convenient way** to view tasks for easier system operation.

## Bulk actions in the system and work with templates

** _Do you often find yourself copying and transferring data manually?_** Some
of Worksection's features allow you to automate and speed up your work with
such tasks.

### [Bulk actions in the system]

You can use the system's **bulk action feature instead of** editing tasks
individually or interacting with participants.

#### Bulk actions with tasks

As soon as you select one or more tasks, a menu will appear in the system that
will allow you to carry out bulk actions.

  

![](/images/upload/Settings_14_eng.@x1.png)  

**You can do this in a bulk mode:**

  * move or copy tasks to another project; 
  * delete or close a task;
  * assign a responsible person;
  * edit visibility; 
  * add tags or status; 
  * assign subscribers; 
  * set deadlines; 
  * add to invoice.

#### ​Bulk actions with people

​In addition to the task, **bulk actions are available in the "People"
section** of the system, where you can select multiple employees:

​​​​​​

![](/images/upload/Masovi_dii_kh2.@x1.gif)  

**The following bulk actions are available:**

  * exporting data; resending the invitation; 
  * transfer participants to another team or department; 
  * setting time limits;
  * granting rights and accesses; 
  * editing participants; 
  * subscribing participants; 
  * delete a participant.​​​

#### Bulk task creation

You can create one or more tasks **using the plus sign** in the main menu.

  

![](/images/upload/Settings_16.@x1_2.png)  

**This is how you copy a task to different projects.** In addition to the
usual task creation information, you can select the projects to which you want
to copy the task.

  

![](/images/upload/Settings_17_eng.@x1.png)​​​

#### Create a group of tasks

**If you need to create several tasks at once,** you can create a task group.
This is done by clicking **the plus sign** and then selecting **“Group of
task”** in the tasks preferences.

### [Dealing with templates]

A template project is different from a regular project in **that it is marked
as "Muted".** These projects **don't receive any notifications,** so they
don't distract people from their work.

  

![](/images/upload/Settings_19_eng.@x1.png)  

**You can copy a task with all its settings from such a project.** Select the
required task and choose **“Copy”** from the menu above.

  

![](/images/upload/Kopijuvannja_kh1.@x1.gif)  

**Next, click “Copy to other project”** and add the copied task to the desired
project.**When copying, you also have access to t** he copy settings with
subtasks, deadlines, and connections, and you can add subscribers to the
project.

## How to use it?

We recommend using the system **based on your business needs.** This way, you
don't have to adapt to the structure of the service, **but the service adapts
to your needs.** In this way, you will get **a real assistant** in organizing
your workflow.

  

_We're confident that you'll get to grips with using the service over time,
and find that you're able to work much more efficiently. Good luck!_
