## Transcription

 Hello, my name is Arena and I am a manager at Work Section. Today I will show you how to start using your new account. Let's begin with account settings, because it's a very important step. Go to your account settings and check time tracking and accounting settings.

If you don't need them, you can turn them off so they won't disturb you. Here you can also set your company's days off and work hours.

The next step is to create your first test project and invite users to the system. Usually, the system suggests creating this project right after the registration. Let's now invite some users to Work Section. To do this, go to the People page.

This page shows the structure of your company and the most important part is that you can invite new team members to your system so they don't need to register themselves. Just enter their emails. I recommend inviting people with the lowest role, user at first. Later, you can give more permissions to team leads and C-level members.

Now you will see one invited user on the People page. You can also see who accepted the invite and who hasn't. If needed, you can resend the invite email. To create a new project, click the green plus button at the top.

You will need to fill in some information like the project name and description. This helps your team understand what they need to do. Then, set up the project deadlines. But if the project is for daily tasks, you can leave the deadline blank.

Next, choose a project manager. This person will organize the work, create and edit tasks and change deadlines if needed. The person who creates the project automatically becomes the manager, but you can change it. You can also set stages and labels for tasks to organize your work better.

Now the project is ready, but has no tasks yet.

Next, you will add tasks and assign them to the team members. Click the green plus button again and choose new task. Creating a task is similar to creating a project. Add a title, a description and assign a responsible person.

You can also attach files related to the task. Don't forget to set a deadline. Without it, the person won't get a reminder and it won't show in reports. Choose a task stage like in progress and create the task.

If you want to quickly create many tasks without full description, use the group of task tab. You can assign different people and deadlines, but no description. Later, you can edit them or use this tool for daily routine tasks. In just a few clicks, we created several tasks and the team members got notifications.

Now it's time to start working with the tasks. I recommend using the training project that's already in your account after registration. Some tasks already have deadlines and assainees. You can use the Kanban board to manage tasks.

It's the easiest tool to start with. It shows all your tasks and their stages. You can move tasks between stages like to do in progress or needs edits. You can also create your own stages in the settings.

In the stages and labels tab, you can create your own set for future projects. You can also create custom labels like type of tasks or results. Labels help to filter and organize tasks back in the project. You can simply drag a task to another stage to move it.

You can also use group change to update the tags of several tasks at once. Just select some of them and choose stage and labels and move them all to in progress. Kanban makes it easy to see what stage each task is at and how the project is going. You can also add comments inside tasks, for example, to explain a delay.

Another useful page is files. It shows all the files from your project, whether they are from the comment section or the task description. You can also upload files here without attaching them to the task. Next is the reports page.

Here you can see how many tasks your team has completed. Detailed report shows ongoing and closed tasks with deadlines. You can also see who completed which task and when. When your projects are ready, you can go to your profile settings.

Every team member has their own settings. Here you can set email, mobile, or desktop notifications. Today I showed how to set up your work section account. If you have any questions, please contact our support team.

They are available 24-7. Thanks for watching and good luck with your projects.
