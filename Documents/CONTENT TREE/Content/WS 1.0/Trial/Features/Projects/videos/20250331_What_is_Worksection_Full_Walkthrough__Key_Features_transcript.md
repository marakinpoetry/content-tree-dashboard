## Transcription

 Hello, my name is Irina and I'm a manager at WorkSection. We are a Ukrainian system made for project management. Our platform has been on the market for 16 years. Today I will show you the main features of WorkSection, including the gun chart, Kanban board, time tracker, financial management and different ways to view tasks.

We will start with the structure. You will work with six main tabs for project management. The first one is people. On the people page, you will see your employees and you can easily invite them by email and set their access rights.

Also, here you can manage work schedules, including vacation, sick leave and set hourly rates for employees. The next page you will use will be projects. On this page, you can quickly see budget usage and working time spent on a project. As we dive into the project, we will see the overview page.

It shows important statistics such as project speed, budget and time usage and also employee activity.

Next, I will show you a couple of task views that you can find in our system. The first one is the classic tasks by list. Here you can see the key details of your tasks, such as assigned people, deadlines, priorities, labels and stages. Labels are used in our system to show the task type and stages show the current stage of the task.

The next view is more for visualization. It is Kanban board. Kanban shows tasks in columns based on their stages. Here you can easily track project progress.

While Kanban is more useful for managers, tasks by date is more helpful for employees. Here all the tasks sorted by deadline. So employees know what to do today, tomorrow or in two weeks. Also, we have tasks by people view.

Here all the tasks are grouped by a senior person. This helps managers see who has too many or too few tasks and control them. If you have a lot of long term projects, the gun chart will be useful for you. Here we can see the timeline view of all the tasks in the project and you can create tasks dependencies to control the order of work.

Additionally, we have a classic calendar view to track tasks, vacations and also sickleaves. It can be synced with any other calendar. For example, Google. I have showed you all the tasks used and now let's move to task details.

Each task contains description, comment section, time and budget tracking. Time spent on tasks can be recorded in two ways, manually or automatically using Time Tracker. All files added to tasks in description or by comments are saved on the files page. It gives the possibility to quickly access the right document.

In our system, you will be able not only control the current tasks, but also analyze your work. For this, we have reports. In the project, you can find detail report, shows completed tasks and costs and report by people, measures, employees, activity. You can also view summary report across multiple projects.

And finally, to make switching to work section easier, we provide an import feature that helps you transfer data from the most popular platforms. Today, we explored the key features of work section. We know that every business is unique and we are ready to help you set up the system for your needs. Book a demo call with our experts using the link below or visit the work section website.
