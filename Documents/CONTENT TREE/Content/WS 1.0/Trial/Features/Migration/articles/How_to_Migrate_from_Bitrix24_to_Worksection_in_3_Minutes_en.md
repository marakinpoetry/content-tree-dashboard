# How to Migrate from Bitrix24 to 
Worksection in 3 Minutes

_The “Bitrix24” service will soon cease its operations in Ukraine and delete
all user data. "**Where and how can we quickly transfer our data from this
system? "** is currently one of the most popular questions among Ukrainian
companies._

  

The answer depends on how Bitrix24 was used because it encompassed various
directions - **CRM, CMS system, Communication,** and **Task Tracking.**
Therefore, under the general name "Bitrix24 CRM," everyone may have their own
understanding.

  

If your company or team works on projects, communicates internally and with
clients regarding problems and tasks, needs clear control over
responsibilities and time tracking, easily transfer your data to
[**Worksection**](https://worksection.com/en/). Worksection is a Ukrainian
service designed for organizing team and project work.
