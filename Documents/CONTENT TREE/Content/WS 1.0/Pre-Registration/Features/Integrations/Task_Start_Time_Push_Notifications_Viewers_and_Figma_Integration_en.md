# Task Start Time, Push Notifications, 
Viewers and Figma Integration

**![](https://worksection.com/images/upload/hi.@x1.gif)**  

**Hi, friends!**

**​  
  
**

We've added an option to set a **task start time** for more accurate workflow
scheduling. Implemented **real-time event updates,** which will speed up any
interactions in the account, and added **Figma integration.**

**  
**

* * *

**  
**

_In previous posts we told you about the new tools for creating and connecting
your own integrations. Read separately about:  
  
_

  * [Webhooks](https://worksection.com/en/blog/webhooks.html#read) — automatic data submission.
  * New possibilities for [creating integrations](https://worksection.com/en/blog/oauth2-api.html#read).
  * [Integration with Zapier](https://worksection.com/en/blog/zapier-update.html#read) — easy automation of processes between services.  
  

**Next, we talk in detail about the new features inside your account!**

  
  
  

##  Task Start Time

​We have received many requests for the ability to set clear time frames for
tasks. Now planning **meetings, calls and working days** has become even
easier.

  

Previously, you saw the creation date and the exact date and time of
completion (deadline) of the task. Now we have added another parameter —
**start time.**

**  
**

When setting a deadline in a task, select**Start-Finish** [1] and you will see
an updated field for setting the **start** [2] and **completion** [3] time of
the task.

{Note} that the time interval for setting the start and finish of the task is
15 minutes.

###### When the task starts, everyone who is subscribed to it will receive a
notification.

We've also added a start time display in the Calendar.

## Real-time actions and instant notifications

​Previously, you received notifications about new events with a slight delay.
Now any notification in the account comes instantly. This is implemented due
to Websockets.

  

The updated speed is very noticeable when communicating through comments,
which already works at the chat level. **A new comment under the task will be
displayed as soon** as the sender clicks the send button, without refreshing
the recipient's page.

### Real-time notifications

​We've made sending notifications about account activity faster. Now it
functions without any delay, second by second.

### Unread notifications

​Now notifications about new tasks and new comments are not read
automatically. Each such event will now be displayed as unread until the user
navigates to a task or comment.

### Task viewers

​Would you like to see if an **employee is reviewing a task** you've given
him? Now it has become even more convenient to work together. **Task viewers**
are displayed in the panel and you can see who is currently viewing tasks with
you.

  

###### This is very convenient if you need to start communication with an
employee.

![](https://worksection.com/images/upload/visions_en.@x1_1.gif)

  
  
This opens up even more opportunities for us to expand collaboration for tasks
in the future. Be sure to stay tuned for future updates!

  

You can be sure that your colleague or subordinate is currently reviewing the
task. **The viewer indicator** is active only when there is any activity on
the task page. Even switching to another browser tab disables the indicator.

  

Don't worry if a colleague doesn't answer you for a long time... Maybe he's
typing a long message. You'll see the **typing animation next to the user**
and be sure to get a response.

## Copying projects

​If you work on projects that are similar in structure, now you don't have to
spend time creating a new project every time. You can use the **Copy project
function.**

  

To do this, go to the **Project Menu** [1] and click **Copy** [2].  
  
  
![](https://worksection.com/images/upload/Winter_update_en_8.@x1.png)

  

  
  
Next, select the checkboxes (subtasks, comments, files, etc.) that you want to
copy from the finished project to the new one, and click **Create a copy**
[3].

## Figma Integration

​From now on, after placing a link to a Figma document in the task description
or in the comments, a Preview of the file appears in the window.

  

You can zoom and move around the design document directly in the Worksection
without following a link.

Stay tuned for our next updates. More to come!
