# TOP-7 Project Management Tools
in 2025

_Today, the world market offers many services for project management. Each of
them has its own unique features and benefits, that help effectively track
workflow and save resources._  
  

## What Should You Know About Project Management Tools?

**Project management tools** allow us to set tasks, plan budget, collaborate
with teammates and stakeholders, provide quality and risk management, track
time and resource allocation. Today there is a huge number of different
project management tracking software, and each has its own list of
characteristics.

  
Their main goal is to simplify, speed up and improve process-based management,
make it more accessible and understandable for everyone.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​That is
why many project management apps try to provide great list of features, user-
friendly interface, and intuitive UI design.

  

## Why You Need Project Management Tools?

Using special tools for project management improves the tracking process. Here
is **some statistical data.  
  
**

  * Due to poor project management nearly **11,4%** of resources (time, money, etc.) are always wasted. 
  * Also **54%** of users believe, that project management apps allow them to save several working hours per day.
  * By the way, **54%** of project managers don’t have appropriate access to workflow data, which makes it difficult for them to roll out the process. 
  * Only **22%** of companies use special software to manage workflow.
  * **77%** of the high performing companies use project management services regularly. 
  * There is a thought, that project managing software market will be worth **$9,81** billion, and will grow by **10,6%** by 2026.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

As you can see, companies that don’t use project management tools have a
**higher risk of failure.**

###### Special software saves time, money, human recourses and presents huge
number of project management solutions.

## What Is The Best Way To Choose Project Management Software?

It may seem a bit strange, but according to statistics only **35% of project
managers are happy with their management tools**. At the same time about
**52%** of users are very disappointed with the software they use.
Interestingly, about **95%** of project managers use more than one tool to
administrate working processes.

  

And here is a question, **why in a world with more than 100 different project
management services, users are still dissatisfied and use several tools at the
time instead of one?** The main problem is inappropriate software for
inappropriate teams. It means that sometimes project managers choose too
complex services that are not suitable for their workflow. In this way, many
features are not used, and a heavy interface prevents users from interaction
and effective workflow tracking.  
  

When choosing a service for project monitoring, you should consider team size,
project duration, tasks complexity, and methodology type (Agile or
Traditional). In this way you can find a tool, which will fit your project the
best.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
