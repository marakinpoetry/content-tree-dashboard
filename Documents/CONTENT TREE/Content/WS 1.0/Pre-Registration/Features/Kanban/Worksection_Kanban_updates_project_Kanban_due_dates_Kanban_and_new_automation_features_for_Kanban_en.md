# Worksection Kanban updates: project 
Kanban, due dates Kanban and new 
automation features for Kanban

**![](https://worksection.com/images/upload/hi.@x1.gif)**  

**Greetings from the Worksection team!​​​**

​​​​​​​​

  

 _We are pleased to announce the release of our spring update for Kanban. We
have enhanced the existing features and added the ability to customize the
tool to fit your business processes._

#### New features include:

  * Project Kanban;
  * Due dates Kanban;
  * New automations for Kanban.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

** _Let's look at the new features
of[Worksection](https://worksection.com/en/) Kanban in more detail._**

## Project Kanban

Now you can **see projects in Kanban view:**

**  
**

**![](/images/upload/Kanban_2_eng_.@x1.png)  
**

This view clearly shows**a company's project stage.** This feature is
particularly useful for companies that create a project in the system for a
specific client or a specific product: _marketing and digital agencies,
product IT companies, construction companies, etc._

### What's new?

Until now, you could filter projects by status. However, this did not allow
you to see projects which were not included in the selected sample. This is
why we decided to find a **new solution and offer it to you.**

**  
**

**![](/images/upload/en_view_switch_kanbanprojects.@x1.gif)  
**

We've expanded your capabilities with Kanban View. Now, information about the
stages of each project**is collected in one place and grouped according to the
status of the project.** Projects that do not have a status are displayed in a
backlog, from which you can easily move them as work on the project begins.

###### **​ Attention!** [Only Premium plans and
higher](https://worksection.com/en/price.html) have project status and labels.

#### Projects Kanban for efficiency improvement

**This allows you to clearly allocate the workload between projects.**
Finally, Kanban's visibility gives you a complete picture of the company's
work and answers relevant organizational questions: how many projects are
pending, how many have been started, and which ones are currently coming to an
end.

**_[Worksection](https://worksection.com/en/) makes business process
optimization more convenient! _**

## Due dates Kanban

The organization of individual users' work **has also been improved.** Each
user now has a **main work page** where they can do their work and at the same
time have an overview of their future tasks. This will be helpful for workload
planning and keeping track of current tasks.

  

![](/images/upload/Kanban_5_eng_.@x1.png)  

Before the update, users could control tasks by applying the filter parameters
by time: "overdue", "today", "for tomorrow", etc. Currently, users can view
their **workload in a single workspace.**

### What's new?

**Groups are created according to users' task due dates.** In this way,
employees can clearly see how many tasks they have without a due date, how
many are overdue, how many are scheduled for today, and which ones are due in
the near future.

  

![](/images/upload/Kanban_6_eng_.@x1.png)  

You can also **easily move a task within the Kanban,** and change its due date
if you have the appropriate permissions. The system lets you select a specific
day for rescheduling. It also takes the weekend into account. Everything you
need to make scheduling tasks for the next few weeks easier.

## New automations for Kanban

There are a few automation enhancements that our users have asked for, in
addition to the updates mentioned above:

### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/0031-fe0f-20e3.png) Set a deadline for a particular
status

Now you can **set due dates** for the completion of a task with a certain
status.

  

![](/images/upload/en_kanban_menu_statusdeadline.@x1.gif)  

You also have the option**to specify conditions** when setting deadlines for
the status:

  

![](/images/upload/Kanban_9_eng_.@x1.png)

  1. **Set** a new deadline. This can be useful if you use statuses to mark certain workflows that have a standard number of days to complete.
  2. **Move forward** means to replace the due date by N number of days when it reaches the corresponding status. For example, the due date is automatically advanced by the number of days you specify when you move a task past the "For Approval" stage. 
  3. **Clear** means to leave the task without a deadline. It is useful for marking tasks that do not need to be checked for due dates in the following stages.
  4. **Do Not Change —** leave the previous due date as is.

​​​​​​​​

These convenient options for setting due dates for a specific status will help
you automate your workflow planning and streamline your management.

### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/0032-fe0f-20e3.png) Establishing the person
responsible for the status

Choose which team member will be responsible **for a specific task status:**

**  
**

![](/images/upload/Kanban_11_eng_.@x1.png)

#### ​​​​[First assignee]

**The first assignee** is the person who was responsible when the task was
created. This is useful when the task needs to come back to the first assignee
after it has passed through a number of stages with different people in
charge.

  

![](/images/upload/Kanban_12_eng_.@x1_1.png)

**  
**

**For example,** an executive creates a task in the system for a SMM manager.
To complete the task successfully, the manager must create tasks for a
copywriter and a designer. Each specialist is responsible for his or her own
phase. When everyone has completed their part of the work, the task is given
the status "Done" and assigned to the first performer. The SMM manager can
then publish a social media post with the materials already in hand.

#### [Previous assignee]

**Previous Assignee** is the assignee at the time of the last automatic shift.
This is useful for interdependent workflows.

  

![](/images/upload/Kanban_13_eng_.@x1.png)  

**For example,** a programmer performs a task with time tracking and submits
the result for testing. After the test, the task is automatically returned to
the programmer when the corresponding status is set. This way, reports keep
track of the actual performer, which is important for controlling the
resources used.

#### [Task Author]

The task author is the user who created the task. Great for workflow
approvals.

apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/1f454.png) Client case

**With a real example of improving the vacation approval workflow,** our
customer shared the convenience of the upgrade.

  

**Previously,** it required the direct involvement of an HR manager to oversee
the process through all stages, which reduced overall efficiency. With the new
automation capabilities, the management of the vacation approval process
**was** **delegated directly to Worksection.**

  

###### _The employee submits a vacation request to the HR manager. The HR
manager then verifies the number of days available and submits the task to the
manager for approval. Based on the results of the review of the vacation
request, the task is assigned the appropriate status: "Approved by Manager" or
"Not Approved by Manager" and is returned to the task author for review._

![](/images/upload/Kanban_14_eng_.@x1.png)  

**In this way,** Worksection has helped to streamline the administrative
process and free up team resources for higher priority tasks.

You can also test the new features of the system with [a free 14-day
trial](https://worksection.com/ua/price.html) or in your profile if you
already have a Worksection account!

  

  

  

Thank you for choosing our service and the possibility to become better!
