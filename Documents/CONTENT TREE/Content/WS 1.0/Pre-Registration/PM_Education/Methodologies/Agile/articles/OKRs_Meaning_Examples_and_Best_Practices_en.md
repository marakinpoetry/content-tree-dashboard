# OKRs: Meaning, Examples, and Best 
Practices

## Introduction to OKRs

###### One of the most widely used tools in business process management is
**Objectives and Key Results (OKR).** OKRs help set goals for the entire team,
synchronize their actions, and motivate them to achieve.

Impressive and motivating, right? Let's take a closer look at what are OKRs
power to organize and inspire your team to achieve the results you want.

## Defining OKRs: Meaning and Framework

In order to understand why and how **OKRs** can help and synchronize a team,
let's start with some basics.

### What is an OKR? Definition and Core Concepts

**An OKR meaning is** a strategic framework that organizations use to set and
communicate clear and measurable goals. OKRs consist of an objective, which is
a clearly defined goal, and key results, which are specific measures that are
used to track the achievement of that goal.

**The objective should be ambitious and motivational,** designed to push the
organization or team beyond its current limits. Meanwhile, to make it easy to
measure progress, the key results should be quantifiable and actionable. This
approach ensures that efforts are focused and aligned with overarching
organizational goals and allows for agile adjustments.

### The OKR Framework: Objectives and Key Results Explained

The OKR management framework works on two levels: **Objectives and Key
Results.** This framework helps break down the path to strategic goals into
actionable, quantifiable steps.

  

**Here's a detail break-down of the acronym:**

  * **O stands for objective,** or goal. It is the Objective that determines where you want to work and inspires your team. In order to do this, it has to be attractive and motivating for everyone involved.
  * **KR stands for Key Results.** These are the step-by-step work items that help you track progress toward the goal.

**​ O (Objective) and KR (Key Results)** work in an integrated way,
complementing and activating each other. For example, the objective has no
numerical measurement, so the key results are necessary to track the
achievement of the objective.

## Crafting Effective OKRs

### How to Write an OKR for business: A Step-by-Step Guide

Focus on your team's goals in different perspectives, from the short term to
the long term, to set OKRs for your organization.

  

**The goals should be:**

  1. **Ambitious**(what the company wants to achieve);
  2. **Specific**(to avoid misunderstandings);
  3. **Measurable** (to see the result for sure);
  4. **Achievable**(to avoid frustration);
  5. **Relevant**(for motivation);
  6. **Time-based** (deadlines are disciplinary).

​Depending on the company's ambitions and current situation, **goals can be
very different:**

  * Increase annual sales by 20%.
  * Launch a new product by the end of the year.
  * Reduce costs by 10%.
  * Department and team goals

​The goals and key results should be in line with the company's vision and
strategy.

  

![](/images/upload/OKR_3_eng.@x1.png)  

You can use the following criteria to help ensure that **OKRs are aligned with
the company's mission:**

  1. Consistency with the company's mission. The company's goals should be consistent with the company's mission, or why the company exists.
  2. Direct link to strategic initiatives. The company's goals should be linked to the company's strategic initiatives, which are the specific steps the company is taking to achieve its mission.

​​Involve senior executives who have the best understanding and vision of the
company in the OKR development process **to ensure that the OKRs are not out
of sync with the company's strategy.** Another useful resource for developing
objectives is documentation of the company's vision and strategy.

## Types of OKRs

### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/1f3af.png) Committed vs. Aspirational OKRs

**Committed OKRs** are those that the organization must achieve because they
are directly linked to critical business objectives. They require a high level
of commitment and resources because they are essential to success.

  *  _**Example.** Increase company revenue by 20% by the end of Q4._

​In contrast, **aspirational OKRs** are stretch goals designed to push the
boundaries of what's possible and drive innovation and growth, even if they're
not fully achieved.

  * _**Example.** Expand into two new international markets by the end of the year._

### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/1f913.png) Learning OKRs

​Rather than focusing on specific performance outcomes, **learning OKRs**
focus on the acquisition of knowledge and skills. They explore new areas,
develop competencies, and prepare teams for future challenges.

  *  _**Example.** Enhance team competency in machine learning by Q3._

### ​![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/2195-fe0f.png) ​Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up OKRs

**​ Top-down OKRs** ensure that each team's efforts are aligned with the
company's strategic goals by starting at the executive or management level and
cascading down through the organizational hierarchy.

  *  _**Example.** Improve operational efficiency by 25% across the company._

**​ Bottom-up OKRs,** on the other hand, are initiated by individual teams or
employees and proposed upward for approval.

  * _**Example.** Enhance customer service satisfaction scores._

### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/1f31f.png) Personal OKRs

**​ Individual objectives** are goals set for individual employees. They are
typically in support of, and have links to, departmental and team OKRs.

  

**Examples of individual OKRs:**

  * _For a marketer: Increase newsletter subscribers by 10%._
  * _For a programmer: Develop a new product feature by the end of the quarter._
  * _For a sales manager: Close a $100,000 deal within a month._

## ​OKR Examples: Illustrating the Concept

​**What is an OKR in business methodolog** y can be applied to a variety of
activities and to different types of teams. The examples below will illustrate
this:

#### Objective: Double the number of clients

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​{​Key Results}

  * Attract 2000 new customers over the next quarter
  * Increase conversion on the website by 10%
  * Increase the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by 5%

#### ​Objective: Make the product the best in its niche

​{Key Results}

  * Reduce the number of software bugs by 20%
  * Increase the number of positive reviews from users by 25%
  * Increase the product rating by 5 positions in the App Store ranking

#### ​Objective: Clients recommend our service to their friends

{Key Results}

  * Reduce the average response time from 10 to 3 minutes
  * Reduce the average ticket closing speed from 40 to 12 hours
  * Increase the customer satisfaction index to 80%

#### ​Objective: Become a global company

​{Key Results}

  * Launch the product in 5 new countries within the next year
  * Increase the number of sales in new countries by 25%
  * Increase product awareness in new countries by 10%

​This approach is suitable for any business sector and company size, as you
can see from these examples. The most important thing to remember when setting
goals and key deliverables is **to take into account the specific goals of the
project and the capabilities of the team.**

  

That's why goals should be ambitious but not too complicated. That is, they
should be achievable. Key Results should be specific and measurable to
objectively track progress toward the goals.

## Advantages of Implementing OKRs

For organizations seeking to increase productivity and align goals at all
levels, objectives and key results (OKRs) have become a critical tool. **Key
benefits of implementing OKRs include:**

  

![](/images/upload/OKR_3_eng.@x1_1.png)

  1. **​ Alignment and engagement: **OKRs promote cross-departmental alignment by linking corporate, team and individual goals to measurable results.
  2. **Increased transparency:** OKRs help foster a culture of openness by making goals and key results visible to all team members. 
  3. **Focus on results:** OKRs encourage organizations to define success in terms of real results, not just the completion of tasks. 
  4. **Increased accountability:** Because OKRs require setting specific and measurable goals, they help increase accountability by making it clear who is responsible for what results. 
  5. **Agility and adaptability:** OKR agile approach support a dynamic planning process that can quickly adapt to change. The short planning cycles allow teams to adjust their strategies in response to changes in the business environment or priorities.

## ​Common Pitfalls in OKR Implementation

​When it comes to setting goals, it's easy to get carried away and make some
common mistakes. Fortunately, these mistakes are also not difficult to avoid
**if you think about them in advance:  
  
**

**![](/images/upload/OKR_4_eng.@x1_1.png)​​​​​​​​​​​​​**

### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/0031-fe0f-20e3.png) Setting Too Many Goals at Once

**Team members feel overwhelmed and don't know what to focus on** when you set
too many goals. Set only 2-3 high-priority goals and then move on to the next
ones to avoid this mistake.

### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/0032-fe0f-20e3.png) Failure to update data regularly

**Update your data regularly.** This is important to keep your goals and key
results effective. Failing to do so will make it difficult to know if you are
progressing toward them and to make timely adjustments.

Set a schedule for reviews and updates and stick to it to avoid this mistake.

### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/0033-fe0f-20e3.png) Lack of Alignment and Focus

Goals and key results work best when the team has alignment and focus on the
process. A simple training session is all that is needed so that everyone in
the company **has an understanding of what OKRs are and how they work.**

* * *

If you focus on quality rather than quantity, **you can easily avoid these
mistakes.** Also, be realistic about what you think you can accomplish. This
will help get the team aligned and buy in.

## Measuring Success: OKR Grading and Evaluation

How do you know if goals are being achieved according to plan? The use of**key
performance indicators (KPIs)** is an effective way to monitor progress toward
key objectives.

  

![](/images/upload/OKR_4_eng.@x1_2.png)​​​​​​​​​

  

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are** metrics that teams use to measure
their performance against their goals when viewed in the context of OKRs. In
other words, KPIs are fully useful in conjunction with OKRs.

  

**In order for KPIs to work, they must be:**

  * Clearly defined and understood;
  * Measured and trackable;
  * Achievable with reasonable effort.
  * Relevant to the goals you are trying to achieve.
  * Have a specific time frame for completion.

​Don't forget to include **progress checks.** Checking help ensure that your
goals are still relevant and that you are on track to achieve them. And
depending on your organization's specific goals and circumstances, the
frequency of check-ins will vary. Some organizations choose to check in weekly
or monthly, while others choose to check in quarterly or annually.

### Role of Reporting in OKR Tracking

In tracking goals and key results, reporting plays an important role. You can
share your progress with colleagues and get their feedback, synchronizing your
efforts.

  

**Reporting can be done formally or informally:**

  * Formal reporting is usually done according to established procedures and formats.
  * Informal reporting can be more free-form and informative in nature.

​Each company needs to determine how best to report to itself. However,
experience shows that reporting that is "built into" the **[Project Management

each task progresses according to plan and is easily tracked throughout the
entire system.
