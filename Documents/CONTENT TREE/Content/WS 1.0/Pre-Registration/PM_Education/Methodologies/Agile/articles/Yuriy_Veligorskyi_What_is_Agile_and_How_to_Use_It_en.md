# Yuriy Veligorskyi: What is Agile and 
How to Use It?

_Yuriy Veligorskyi is an Agile coach and Scrum trainer, a guest lecturer at
Advance Business School in Agile/Scrum. He helps create Agile culture and
build flexible processes in both IT and non-IT companies, enabling teams to
become more effective, continuously improve their products, and increase
business efficiency._

## About Agile

Agile is a philosophy with specific views and values that teams should follow
for effective work. It does not contain specific instructions. Its foundation
is the 12 principles and 4 values described in the ["Manifesto for Agile
Software Development".](https://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/manifesto.html)

  

In Agile, all work is based on **four core values:**

  1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
  2. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
  3. Working software over comprehensive documentation.
  4. Responding to change over following a plan.

​​In a world where everything changes rapidly, every company wants to keep up
with the times and follow trends. To do this, the time from idea to market
launch must be as short as possible.

  

When you are a small company or startup, this might not be difficult. Large
companies have two options: achieve results through strict and prolonged
directives or make your employees happy, allow them to influence processes,
give feedback, and have a clear direction on where and how to go. In short,
this is Agile.

  

It is important to remember that Agile should not be the goal. Primarily, you
need to strive for changes in organizational culture, openness, and
transparency.

## Scrum and Other Smart Words...

Scrum, Kanban, LeSS, SAFe, and other smart words are ways to organize work in
the spirit of Agile.

  

Scrum is often called a methodology, but it is not. Scrum is a framework, a
process template, or a process skeleton. It is a framework description of how
you should work to achieve your goal. While using this framework, you can add
something of your own that does not contradict the structure and values of
Scrum.

### Why Do You Need an Agile Coach?

People often ask: "What is an Agile coach?". The term consists of two words.
We have already figured out Agile. A coach is a guide, a person who helps to
reach a goal and promote positive changes. Initially, it may seem like a
"traditional consultant," but there is a fundamental difference. A consultant
tells you what to do, while a coach helps the client get to where they want to
go. You could say an Agile coach is a trainer, teacher, mentor, facilitator,
and Agile expert all in one. They work both at the team and organizational
levels.

  

> The job of an Agile coach is not just working with a team but involves deep
> organizational changes across the entire company.

### Agile Only for IT?

Yes, there is an opinion that Agile is only suitable for IT industries. This
belief is based on the fact that the Agile movement was created by a group of
developers. But today, these principles are followed by various companies
worldwide. Successful experiences in banking, insurance, healthcare, and many
other sectors show that Agile can be applied anywhere, regardless of the
company, country, or industry.

  

Agile is a culture, and culture knows no boundaries!

### What Problems Does Agile Solve?

Many managers want people to work quickly and efficiently, be ready for
uncertainties, and have clear processes. They also want interactions to be
open and transparent. Sounds great, right?

  

Agile addresses all these needs. Agile is not a final state but a way of
thinking and living.

### How to Start "Flexible Changes"?

It's important to understand that Agile, like any other cultural change, does
not happen with a wave of a magic wand. Agile transformation is a full-fledged
project and quite time-consuming. The smaller the company and the smaller the
division, the easier and faster the transformation will take place. In large
companies, transformation can take 3-5 years. Unfortunately, you can't just
plan to become Agile and expect it to happen by itself in six months.

  

Start by understanding where your company is now and where it wants to be
after the transformation. Build a path between these two points to create a
specific action plan.

## Visualization Tools

A board is just a tool to visualize everything as much as possible.

  

![](https://worksection.com/images/upload/scrum_task_board.png)

It can be on a flipchart, a wall, or in electronic form. Each team chooses the
board that suits them best. But the most important thing is that it improves
interaction among team members.

  

The choice of board depends on the team, budget, situation, and number of
participants. For electronic boards, free or conditionally free options
include Trello and Redmine, each with its own features. Well-known companies
like VersionOne or Jira are also options. Among Ukrainian companies, I would
highlight [Worksection](https://worksection.com/en/), which recently released
a task board. I hope this product will have killer features that most boards
lack, such as limiting the number of tasks in a column or per person, or an
urgent task lane for high-priority tasks.

## About Implementation

A common question is: "What is needed for Scrum to work?" Here’s the secret:
there is no silver bullet. Cultural changes are always the most difficult and
time-consuming. You can't just come to work and say, "Today we have a Scrum
training, and in three days we will start working with Scrum." No, it doesn't
work like that. Agile is not a switch that you can flip and say, "We have
become Agile."

With Agile approaches, modern leaders create an atmosphere in the organization
that inspires people to achieve goals. Employees are not afraid to propose
solutions, create something new, and they know they will not be judged for
mistakes.

Agile is not: "Coach, do something with my people." It is rather: "Coach, help
me become a better leader so I can create an engaging environment, learn to
listen to my people, and make a great team out of them."
