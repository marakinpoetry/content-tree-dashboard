# From Chaos to Project Management: 
The Essential Guide

Project management is more than just a methodology; it encompasses specific
methods like Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, and Kanban, which are instrumental in
achieving project goals efficiently. Simply put, the foundation of project
management is effective management itself, which directly influences project
success and adherence to deadlines.

#### Typical Chaos in Project Management

In many organizations still new to project management principles, the scene
often looks chaotic:

  1. Projects are managed across spreadsheets, cloud documents, and various files with occasional lost access;
  2. Communication within teams is fragmented across emails, messengers, or verbal discussions that are never documented;
  3. There’s often no clear understanding of the project's ultimate goal;
  4. Projects lack breakdown into smaller tasks with specific objectives, responsibilities, and accountable persons;
  5. Teams frequently jump from one stage of a project to another or switch between projects without completion;
  6. There’s a lack of clear role distribution within the team—confusion over who is the Executor, the Responsible person, and the Project Manager.

​​Such chaos is typical for companies far from implementing project management
principles effectively, making the transition painful for the entire team.

## What Effective Project Management Looks Like

### The Agile Family: Agile, Scrum, Kanban

Before Agile, Waterfall (a sequential or cascade model) was the most popular
method. Waterfall operates on a linear sequential design, meaning once a phase
of development is completed, developers move on to the next stage and cannot
go back. This was practical until flexible methods like Agile proved that
adaptability could significantly reduce risks and conserve resources,
including budget and reputation—often the first casualty when a project fails.

### Characteristics of Agile Project Management

To clarify, Agile is a flexible alternative to the rigid Waterfall method,
with Scrum and Kanban as tools within the Agile framework.

#### Key features of Agile include:

  * Work processes are divided into short sprints lasting from one week to one month.
  * Adjustments can be made during the project lifecycle.
  * The primary focus is on delivering a finished product over comprehensive documentation.
  * Close collaboration with the client throughout the project lifecycle, allowing client involvement in every process.
  * Every team member is responsible for the end result of the project.

​​​​​​​​

Scrum and Kanban, initially popular in IT, have proven versatile across
various industries, including engineering and manufacturing.

## Implementing Scrum in Project Management Systems

### Steps to apply Scrum effectively:

  * Define tasks clearly — each task equals one sprint.
  * Despite individual responsibilities, Scrum emphasizes collective responsibility for the overall project outcome.
  * Continuous involvement from the company owner and the scrum master is crucial for monitoring and timely adjustments.​

​​​​​

Scrum is ideally suited for startups due to its focus on team accountability
without pinpointing blame for delays.

## Implementing Kanban in Project Management Systems

### Key aspects of Kanban:

  * Kanban uses a virtual board to move tasks through various stages, visible to the entire team.
  * It allows for flexibility and real-time updates, making it suitable for projects needing continuous adjustment.
  * Kanban is perfect for short-term projects or tasks that benefit from being broken down into smaller components.

​​

**Conclusion:** While Scrum focuses on control and structure, Kanban
emphasizes flexibility. For new projects with many unknowns or startups,
beginning with the Scrum approach is advisable. As tasks become more routine
and the workflow stabilizes, transitioning to Kanban can offer more
flexibility and efficiency.
