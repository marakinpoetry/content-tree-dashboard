# Ultimate Guide to Project Charter: 
Definitions, Creation, and Examples

###### A project charter is a fundamental document in project management. It
is the formal authorization for the existence of a project and the road map
for its execution and control. The charter serves as both a directive and a
contract. It facilitates the project manager's authority to allocate
organizational resources to project activities.

  

**A Project Charter (PC)** explains the direction your organization is taking
and why,

what will change, and what risks will arise.

  

Creating a project charter is a fundamental step that aligns with the best
practices outlined by the Project Management Institute (PMI). For
professionals who are certified as a Project Management Professional (PMP),
the creation of a project charter**is an essential skill set.** This PMI
certification ensures that project managers can apply global project
management standards, including the standards for initiating and scheduling
projects.

  

This document not only contains basic information, but also**reflects the
overall vision** of the stakeholders. The project charter is usually created
at the earliest stage of the project, before the project team (PT) is formed.
It is typically written in collaboration with other project participants and
submitted to stakeholders **for final review.** The charter is signed by the
sponsors in most cases.

## Defining the Project Charter

### What is a Project Charter in Project Management?

**The project charter** definition encompasses a **formal document** that not
only defines the scope, objectives, and participants of a project but also
serves as a **foundational tool** in the project management process. This
essential document outlines the project's goals, key stakeholders, budget,
schedule, and overall direction, providing a critical framework for guiding
the project's execution and management.

  

The charter authorizes the project manager to use organizational resources**to
achieve the objectives** and is typically approved at the beginning of the
project lifecycle. It is better to fit all the information into a maximum of
**1-2 pages.**

  

**For example,** the project charter can look like a text document, a Google
doc, or a presentation. You can also use [a project management
system](https://worksection.com/en/) with the possibility of specification of
the project charter in the description.

###### _Project description on the Worksection project dashboard_

#### **What does the PC clarify?**

  * What kind of professional becomes a Project Manager (PM) and what are his/her responsibilities?
  * The purpose of the project and its relationship to business metrics
  * Who approves and funds the project
  * The composition of the project team, the requirements and expectations of the project, and the responsibilities of each participant
  * Criteria for success

### ​Project Charter vs. Project Plan

​The project charter is created in the early stages of a project to broadly
**define the vision and scope of the project.** It includes high-level project
details such as objectives, key stakeholders, and the project manager's level
of authority. Conversely, a project plan is developed after the project
charter and provides detailed information on **how the project will be
executed, monitored, and closed.** The project plan includes detailed
schedules, resource allocations, risk management plans, and communication
plans.

  

The project charter **sets the strategic framework for a project** and
provides a macro view of the necessary elements for project initiation. In
contrast, the project plan serves as a tactical guide that manages the
execution phase of the project, **focusing on the operational details and
logistics** of project management.

  

The relationship between the project charter and the project plan**is
synergistic,** as the clarity and direction provided by the charter directly
influences the detailed planning and ultimate success of the project. The
charter provides **initial alignment with the organization's strategic
goals,** while the plan operationalizes those goals into actionable steps,
schedules, and resource plans.

### Purpose of a Project Charter

Three critical risks underline the importance of having a well-drafted project
charter, which can make or break the success of a project:

  

  1. **Lack of Authority and Resources:** Without a project charter, the project manager may face significant hurdles in exerting authority and securing necessary resources. The charter serves as an official document that gains stakeholder approval, essentially granting the project management the mandate to operate within defined parameters. This approval is crucial as it supports the project manager in acquiring the necessary resources and authority without having to constantly negotiate or justify each decision, thus preventing delays and disruptions.
  2. **Unclear Project Expectations:** A project without a charter risks having nebulous goals, leading to scope creep—a situation where the project's goals expand beyond the original plans without proper control. A charter outlines the project’s objectives and deliverables clearly, setting a defined path and expectations from the outset. This clarity helps in maintaining focus and aligning the project team's efforts with the predefined outcomes, thereby reducing the likelihood of project sprawl and misaligned deliverables.
  3. **Misalignment with Organizational Goals:** Projects initiated without a charter may inadvertently stray from or contradict the broader organizational goals. A well-constructed charter links the project to the organization’s strategic objectives, explaining how the project contributes to the overall business strategy. This alignment is crucial for securing ongoing support from upper management and ensuring that the project contributes positively to the company’s long-term success.

## Key Components of a Project Charter

### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/1f4cd.png) Project Objectives and Constraints

A project charter outlines the primary objectives of the project, **specifying
the desired outcomes that align with broader organizational goals.** It also
details the constraints or limitations within which the project must operate,
such as budget limits, time constraints, resource availability, and specific
scope boundaries. The articulation of both goals and constraints in the
charter is critical. This dual focus**guides every phase of the project
lifecycle,** from planning through execution, ensuring that the project stays
on track while efficiently managing resources and stakeholder expectations.

  

Setting clear objectives provides the project team **with a measurable
standard** against which to measure progress and success, while constraints
help ensure that the project does not overreach and remains focused on
essential deliverables. Together, these elements frame a strategic approach
that is critical to aligning the project with the overall strategic direction
of the organization, **facilitating effective decision-making and project
management practices.**

### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/23f2-fe0f.png) Project Timeline

**The project timeline** is an essential component of the project charter. It
details **the start and end dates** of the project and maps out**key
milestones and deadlines.** The inclusion of a timeline in the project charter
helps in setting a clear schedule that all project participants can follow. It
serves as a tool for monitoring progress and ensures that **the project
remains on track** to meet its defined objectives within the allocated time.
Effective timelines are not just schedules; they are strategic tools that help
manage resources, adjust priorities, and mitigate potential delays or risks.

### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/1f64b.png) Key Stakeholders

Identifying **key stakeholders** in the project charter is crucial for project
success. Stakeholders typically include anyone impacted by the project or
those**who have influence over the project outcome.** This group might include
project sponsors, team members, customers, end-users, or external suppliers.
The charter should explicitly define the roles, responsibilities, and
expectations of each stakeholder to foster transparency and accountability.

  

Understanding who the stakeholders are and their respective stakes in the
project is essential **for developing tailored communication** and project
management strategies that support collaborative and effective project
execution. Precisely identifying these stakeholders ensures that all necessary
inputs are considered and that the project addresses **all relevant interests
and requirements,** which is critical for achieving the desired outcomes and
ensuring project alignment with broader business objectives.

### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/26a0-fe0f.png) Identified Risks

The project charter must **anticipate and outline potential risks** that could
impact the project's trajectory from its outset. These risks might include
budgetary constraints, timeline delays, technological failures, resource
availability, or external factors such as regulatory changes. Documenting
these risks is crucial as it prepares the project team to handle challenges
proactively. Effective risk identification helps **in developing mitigation
strategies** that can be implemented should these risks materialize, ensuring
that the project remains on track towards its objectives.

### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/2705.png) Project Benefits

The project charter should**clearly articulate the benefits** expected from
completing the project. These benefits often align with strategic business
goals and can include increased efficiency, cost savings, enhanced customer
satisfaction, or competitive advantages. Highlighting these benefits is
essential not only for justifying the project's initiation but also**for
maintaining stakeholder engagement and support** throughout the project
lifecycle. It provides a clear vision of what the organization aims to
achieve, serving as a continual reference point for the project's value
proposition.

### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/1f9ee.png) Budget Overview

**The budget summary** in a project charter is critical to establishing the
financial framework for a project. This section not only provides **a detailed
estimate of the funds** needed to cover all expected costs-such as labor,
materials, technology, and contingencies-but also anticipates potential
financial overruns and includes plans for such instances.

  

In defining these financial parameters, the project charter helps stakeholders
**understand the economic feasibility and resources required,** facilitating
better investment decisions and financial oversight. This comprehensive
financial outline ensures that all project participants are aware of **the
cost implications and financial responsibilities,** which is critical to
maintaining transparency and preventing budget overruns, thereby ensuring the
financial viability of the project.

## Crafting a Project Charter

### Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Project Charter

#### [Step 1] Understand key project goals and objectives

**Start by clearly defining what the project aims to achieve.** Engage with
key stakeholders to gather insights and expectations. List 3-5 smaller goals
to be accomplished as the project progresses. Make sure they are specific,
measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. In other words, they are
[SMART.](https://worksection.com/en/blog/smart-goals.html)

  

**Analyze** how the project may affect the organization's business
performance.

#### [Step 2] Define project organization

**Outline the structure of the project team and identify roles and
responsibilities.** This includes specifying who the project manager is,
defining the roles of team members, and establishing the hierarchy and
communication channels within the team.**Clarifying this early helps prevent
confusion and sets the framework** for accountability and authority within the
project.

project, allowing you to easily organize working within a team as well as
[with clients and freelancers.](https://worksection.com/en/blog/work-
organization.html)

#### [Step 3] Create an implementation plan

**Develop a detailed plan that outlines how the project objectives will be
achieved.** This should include the phases of the project, key activities,
milestones, and deadlines. The implementation plan should also detail the
resources required for each stage of the project, including time, budget, and
human resources.

#### [Step 4] List potential problem areas

**Perform a risk assessment to identify potential problems** such as resource
allocation, delayed schedules, or external dependencies. Outline mitigation
strategies for these risks. This proactive approach not only prepares the team
to handle difficulties. It also demonstrates thorough planning and foresight.

### Post-Creation Steps

The next steps in moving a project from planning to execution are critical
after the project charter is created. These steps after the creation of the
project charter **ensure that the project is formally approved and that the
scope of the project is clearly defined** and agreed upon by all stakeholders.

#### {Step 1} Authorize the project

**The first step after the creation of the project charter is** to obtain
formal approval for the project. This is typically the review and approval of
the project charter by key stakeholders such as project sponsors, senior
management, or the project board.

  

Approval serves as an official green light that **the project is aligned with
strategic goals** and has the necessary backing in terms of resources and
executive support. It also authorizes the project management to allocate
resources and make necessary project-related decisions.

#### {Step 2} Develop a scope statement

The development of a detailed [scope
statement](https://worksection.com/en/blog/project-scope.html) is critical
once the project is approved. **This document provides a more detailed
description of the project's deliverables,** boundaries, and acceptance
criteria, building on the initial scope outlined in the project charter.

  

To prevent **scope creep,** the scope statement should clearly state what is
included and what is excluded from the project. It also provides **a clear
reference** that stakeholders can agree on and helps define the criteria for
what constitutes project success.

the project charter to the team

Presenting the Project Charter effectively means clearly communicating its key
components to ensure that all team members understand the scope of the
project, what it's trying to accomplish, and their individual roles within the
project. Best practices include:

  * **Hold a kickoff meeting:** Give team members the opportunity to ask questions and clarify their understanding by reviewing the charter in detail at this meeting.
  * **Use visual aids:** More complex aspects of the charter, such as timelines and dependencies, can be illustrated with charts, graphs, and slides.
  * **Distribute copies:** Make sure that every member of the team has access to the charter, preferably in a format that they can refer to throughout the project.
  * **Highlight key points:** Highlight critical elements such as milestones, key deliverables, and the escalation path for issues.
  * **Encourage feedback:** Allow team members to provide input on the charter, which can help identify potential problems early and engage the team in the project's success.

​These steps can significantly improve team engagement and project outcomes by
fostering a transparent and inclusive approach to project planning and
execution.

## Conclusion

**A Project Charter is a document that lists the key objectives of the
project,** defines who's involved, and establishes criteria for success. By
establishing authority and certifying **the availability of necessary
resources,** the charter is important to the project manager and team.

  

New opportunities and potential risks, methodology, budget, and schedule are
disclosed in this document. The charter **must demonstrate the project's
benefits** to the organization.

  

Without an up-to-date charter, the project manager and team members**risk an
ongoing battle for influence and funding.** Not having one can also cause the
project to get bogged down.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
