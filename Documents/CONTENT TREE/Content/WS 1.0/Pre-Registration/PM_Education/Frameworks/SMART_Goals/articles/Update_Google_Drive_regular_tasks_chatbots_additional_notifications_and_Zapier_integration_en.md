# Update: Google Drive, regular tasks, 
chatbots, additional notifications, and 
Zapier integration

In the winter update of Worksection, we added even more useful features for
convenient work and process automation:

  * Working with Google Drive
  * Display scheduled regular tasks 
  * Notification about the start and finish of the task
  * Telegram bot and Viber bot improvement
  * Extending integration through Zapier

## ​Working with Google Drive

​Previously, to work with Google Drive, each user had to separately connect
account synchronization in their profile settings. We have simplified this
process. Now Google Drive integration is available **for all users** by
default.

### How do I work with Google Drive?

Click the **" Google Drive file**" button in any task and open access to your
storage for Worksection.

#### ​​There are three ways to add files:  

  1. **Share** file without editing permission.
  2. **​ Edit together **to collaborate on a document. Changes are automatically saved to a file on Google Drive.
  3. **Copy to project** to upload the file to Worksection and save a separate version.

#### ​❗️Please note

  * ​Google limits the session time. After a certain period, the system may ask for re-authorization.
  * The Google Drive feature is not yet available on smartphones.

## ​Display regular tasks

​Previously, upcoming recurring tasks were not displayed in the calendar and
Gantt chart. Now you can**see recurring tasks in advance.**

### How to turn on

Go to your account settings and select **Show future recurrences** in the
**Task options** section.

## Notification about the start of the task

Additional notifications let you know when a task is about to start and
finish. Previously, you could receive notifications two hours, one hour, and
30 minutes before. Now, you can receive reminders **15 minutes and 5 minutes**
before start and finish of the task.

## Telegram bot and Viber bot now in Ukrainian

Receiving task notifications and updates has become even easier. Our Telegram
bot and Viber bot are now available in Ukrainian. In addition, we have
**improved and expanded the list of commands.**

## Extending integration through Zapier

We remind you that Worksection has integration with [Zapier.
](https://worksection.com/en/faq/zapier.html)This allows you to quickly and
easily set up automations between Worksection and other services.

### What's new?

Worksection now allows you **to** **use task tags as a trigger in Zapier.**  
  
**_For example,_** you can set up authorization so that all tasks labeled
"Meeting" will trigger a Google Meet call. In this scenario, when you create a
task in the corresponding project with the "Meeting" label, Zapier will
automatically create a Google Meet call.

This is just one way to use the new trigger. Use automations with Zapier to
save time synchronizing between tools.

_Sincerely yours,_

_Worksection team_
