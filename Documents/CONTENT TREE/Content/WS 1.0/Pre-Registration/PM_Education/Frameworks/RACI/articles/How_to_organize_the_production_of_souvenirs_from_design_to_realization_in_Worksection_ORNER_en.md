# How to organize the production of 
souvenirs from design to realization in 
Worksection – ORNER

ORNER has been operating in the Ukrainian market for 11 years and has a **team
of 40 specialists.** These are designers, marketers, logistics, accountants
and other departments.

  

The company is constantly growing and trying out new directions. The pace of
development has shaped the company's need to transparently manage various
processes. ORNER implemented Worksection to maintain control and scale the
business without chaos.

## About the company

[ORNER](https://orner.com.ua/en) is a Ukrainian brand that develops and
produces quality gifts at affordable prices. The company's products include
tableware, stationery, board games, textiles, etc. The brand cooperates only
with Ukrainian manufacturers and controls every stage of the production
process, from the idea to the finished product.

  

The team of 40 specialists successfully **processes 100,000 orders a year,**
creating new designs and constantly testing new formats.

## Request

ORNER used [Trello](https://worksection.com/en/blog/worksection-vs-
trello.html) before it started working with Worksection. After a while, the
tool no longer met the company's needs. Tasks accumulated in the form of
lists, and it was difficult to track changes.

  

> “Trello is more like a notebook for tasks, and we needed a tool with
> advanced functionality to systematize them”, — Olena Sidenko, Art Director
> at ORNER

  

In addition to chaotic task management, there were difficulties with file
storage and sharing. It was impossible to upload large documents, which
created problems for designers, marketers, and other teams.

  

Approving layouts, creating collateral and technical specifications requires
constant access to the latest versions of documents. But because of Trello's
limitations, important information was often lost.

  

These challenges created a need for **a platform that would systematize task
management and provide convenient file management in a single system.**

## Client challenges

### New system implementation

###### **Problem:** Switching from Trello to Worksection required learning a
new tool along with revising established workflows. As Trello had become part
of the daily routine, these changes caused resistance from the team and
required time to adapt.

* * *

**Solution:** The company paid special attention to the adaptation process.
Each employee was given enough time to master Worksection without unnecessary
pressure.

  

> “I'm sure that changes should happen organically, otherwise they don't stick
> for long”, – Olena Sidenko, Art Director at ORNER

  

The company appointed a responsible person to manage the implementation
process to switch to Worksection. Consultations with the Worksection manager
helped to dive deeper into the system and understand how to better customize
the tool to the needs of the team.

  

Now the company has created separate projects in Worksection for each business
area. Tasks are divided into categories, such as current, new ideas, and
pending.

### Unifying work tools

###### **The problem:** Tasks were set via email or messengers, sick leave and
vacation were noted in a separate service, and work files were stored in
different tools. This complicated the management process due to the need for
constant reconciliation between tools.

* * *

**Solution:** Worksection unified all processes in one system, simplifying
task management and file sharing.

  

The functionality of employee schedules allows seeing who from the team is on
vacation or on sick leave. This made possible to abandon other tools for
controlling employees' days off.

> “The function of marking vacations and sick leave is great. It's convenient
> to enter a task and see if the person in charge is on vacation or sick”, –
> Olena Sidenko, Art Director at ORNER

### Work structuring

###### **Problem:** The lack of a monitoring system made it difficult to meet
deadlines. It was difficult to coordinate many tasks with different statuses
and priorities. As a result, tasks were delayed at certain stages.

* * *

**Solution:** The use of custom statuses helped to systematize workflows and
respond quickly to problematic stages. Additionally, the team appointed a
responsible person to monitor updates and deadlines in Worksection.

This significantly reduced the risk of missing deadlines and improved process
continuity. This approach increased the predictability of tasks and minimized
time lost due to inconsistencies in the team.

### Workload control and planning

###### **Problem:** Lack of accurate data on time spent on tasks led to
inaccuracies in workload planning. Deadlines were set roughly, and uneven
workloads were stressful for the team.

* * *

**Solution:** Implementing a time tracker allowed the team to objectively
measure time spent on tasks. This helped to plan deadlines more accurately and
avoid overloading the team.

  

> “It is important to be able to identify the moment when changes no longer
> improve the result. Thanks to the time tracker, you can see how much time is
> spent on each stage and whether it is worth spending more resources on it”,
> – Olena Sidenko, Art Director at ORNER.

The transparent reporting system provided real data for analyzing productivity
and properly planning future projects. Understanding the team's workload
helped to allocate resources efficiently, optimize workflows, and reduce the
risk of missing deadlines.

### Lots of notifications and updates

###### **The problem:** Task update notifications were being sent to work
emails, causing confusion and clogging inboxes. As a result, important
messages were lost in the shuffle and the team could miss critical updates.

* * *

**Solution:** Worksection's integration with Telegram allowed the team to
receive notifications in a convenient format and respond quickly to changes.
It simplified communication between task participants and eliminated the need
to create separate chats for discussions.

  

> “The integration of Worksection with Telegram has made our work much easier.
> All notifications are always at our fingertips, and we can instantly see
> updates on tasks”, said Olena Sidenko, Art Director at ORNER.

The mobile version of Worksection provides instant access to updates, which is
especially important for quick reviews and approvals.

* * *

#### _​“Each task in Worksection is a separate folder with all the necessary
information. You can go back to a task in a few months and understand who was
responsible for what and at what stage there were delays”, – Olena Sidenko,
Art Director at ORNER_ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
