### Step 1: Use Your SWOT to Set Priorities

![](/images/upload/Strategic_planning_process_22_eng_.@x1_1.png)  

In this critical step of the strategic planning process, the organization
**utilizes the insights gained from the SWOT analysis** to determine strategic
priorities. Using the TOWS Strategic Alternatives Matrix, strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats are strategically combined to identify
key priorities.

  

**This method guides decision-making,** helping the organization leverage its
strengths to capitalize on opportunities, address weaknesses, and mitigate
threats. The outcome is a prioritized list of strategic initiatives that align
with the organization's goals and provide a focused roadmap for effective
strategic planning and execution.

#### TOWS Strategic Alternatives Matrix

The TOWS Strategic Alternatives Matrix is a powerful tool that aids in
**determining strategic priorities** by systematically combining external
opportunities and threats with internal strengths and weaknesses identified in
a SWOT analysis.

  

**By examining the intersections of these factors,** the matrix generates
strategic insights, helping organizations capitalize on strengths to exploit
opportunities, address weaknesses to overcome threats, and devise proactive
strategies. This comprehensive approach for strategic planning process
facilitates a nuanced understanding of the competitive landscape, guiding the
selection of prioritized initiatives aligned with the organization's
overarching goals.

### Step 2: Define Long-Term Strategic
Objectives​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

![](/images/upload/Strategic_planning_process_23_eng_.@x1_1.png)  

In this crucial step of strategic planning, organizations articulate long-term
