# 10 Types of Organizational Structures 
for Companies

**Organizational structure** of a company helps to see the “inside” of the
business: how roles and responsibilities are distributed within it, and even
how the main business processes proceed. The business organizational chart
helps to identify the “weak points” of the business, effectively plan and
reduce costs, and develop a productive management strategy.

  

In this article, we will talk about **the most popular types of organizational
structure** of an enterprise and figure out how to build an optimal corporate
structure chart with org chart examples.

## What Is an Organizational Structure?

The organizational structure of an enterprise is a model that explains the
relationships **between employees or entire departments.**

  

It builds a hierarchy within the company and determines the principle of
action when making and executing decisions.

  

The rights and responsibilities of managers and employees are established
based on the organizational structure. In addition, the types of
organizational structure influence the key roles to achieve overall business
goals.

**We will discuss the 10 main organizational structure types common in
business management.** And let us immediately note: this is not a dogma. There
are no restrictions in the selection and application of specific
organizational charts. You can adapt the organizational structure for
yourself, change or combine different types of organizational systems for
different areas of activity. But you need to understand the features of each
of the types of organizational structures to do this.

structure

**The Hierarchical Organizational structure** of a company refers to classic
types of organizational systems. It establishes clearly defined functions,
rights and responsibilities of employees. The central node is responsible for
control.

  

![](/images/upload/Corporate_Structures_3.@x1.png)  

At its core, a hierarchical structure refers to a pyramid: **the highest level
of power sits at the top, and the levels of power decrease from top to down.**

  

In this method of organization, decision-making is also top-down. Executives
or upper management make crucial decisions and then pass them down to middle
managers, and further down to lower-level employees for implementation.

  

There are hierarchical organizations with different levels of management,
power or authority. This is the **dominant mode for large traditional
organizations** like Governments and organized religions.

### [Pros]

  * Simple and clear organizational structure;
  * Has a clear hierarchy and reporting lines;
  * Easy to manage;
  * Effective for small companies.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### [Cons]

  * Inflexible and slow to make decisions;
  * Limited communication between departments;
  * Not suitable for fast-growing companies.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/0032-fe0f-20e3.png) Functional Organizational
structure

This type of organizational framework involves the**division of
responsibilities according to professional skills.** Employees are grouped
according to the function they provide. Besides the general director, there
are directors responsible for their areas: sales, production, marketing
director, etc.

  

![](/images/upload/Corporate_Structures_4.@x1.png)  

**A Functional structure** is one of the most common among other types of
organizational structures. This structure establishes clear expectations and
has a well-defined chain of command. However, this structure runs the risk of
being too confining, it can impede employee growth and cross-department
communication and collaboration.

  

At the same time, functional structure facilitates specialization, scalability
and accountability. This model is **traditionally used by holdings** —
enterprises with many areas of activity and a wide range of products.

### [Pros]

  * High specialization of employees;
  * Efficient use of resources;
  * Easy to coordinate the work of specialists.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### [Cons]

  * Bureaucratic and slow;
  * Limited cross-functional communication;
  * Not suitable for fast changing markets.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/0033-fe0f-20e3.png) Horizontal or flat
Organizational structure

Management system with a **minimum number of middle managers.** Decisions in
such types of organizational systems are mainly made by line employees with
relevant experience and competencies.

  

![](/images/upload/Corporate_Structures_5.@x1.png)  

Under a **Horizontal structure,** the company has a short chain of command. It
allows employees to focus and invest time in big goals because they have more
autonomy, freedom and independence to carry out their roles and
responsibilities.

  

This corporate structure type is mostly adopted by**small companies and start-
ups** in their early stage because their work and effort in a small company
are relatively transparent. So, decision-making power is shared and employees
are held accountable for their decisions.

  

**Horizontal or flat Organizational structure is almost impossible or just
useless for larger companies** with many projects and employees. Most likely,
as your business grows, you will have to choose from other types of
organizational systems.

### [Pros]

  * Fast decision-making;
  * Excellent communication and cooperation;
  * High employee motivation.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### [Cons]

  * Requires highly qualified and self-disciplined employees;
  * Not suitable for large companies;
  * Complex tasks are difficult to coordinate.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/0034-fe0f-20e3.png) Divisional Organizational
structure

In this organizational structure, **the general manager is responsible for**
the strategy and development of the company, and **the heads of divisions are
responsible for** their operational management. The duties, responsibilities
and tasks of each manager will depend on the business specific.

  

![](/images/upload/Corporate_Structures_6.@x1.png)  

The divisional organizational structure**is used more often than other types
of organizational systems by corporations and large organizations** due to its
wider range of products and services. Each division has its own division which
corresponds to either products or geographies and contains the necessary
resources and functions needed to support the product line and geography.

  

Such corporations can focus on various divisions more closely with Divisional
organizational structure. **The main advantage of this structure is the
independent operational flow,** that failure of one company does not threaten
the existence of the others.

### [Pros]

  * Quick adaptation to market changes
  * Unit autonomy
  * Increasing the responsibility of managers.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### [Cons]

  * Duplication of functions
  * High costs and increase in accounting taxes
  * Difficult cross-department coordination.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/0035-fe0f-20e3.png) Matrix Organizational structure

Complex organizational structure, where the**performer simultaneously reports
to the functional manager and the project manager.** Narrow specialists may be
temporarily subordinated to the manager of a specific project. However, he is
not relieved of his main job.

  

![](/images/upload/Corporate_Structures_7.@x1.png)  

**For example,** a PR specialist may have reporting obligations within the
marketing and product teams. A more complex example for a large company: all
engineers may be in one engineering department and report to an engineering
manager. But these same engineers may be assigned to different projects and
might be reporting to those project managers as well.

  

**[A Matrix Organizational structure](https://worksection.com/en/blog/matrix-
organization.html) **can be more complex than other types of organizational
systems, so it can cause confusion about accountability and communication,
especially among new employees. There are multiple reporting obligations in
such an organizational structure.

### [Pros]

  * Flexible and adaptive organizational structure;
  * Efficient use of resources;
  * Allows you to implement complex projects.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### [Cons]

  * Complex and confusing due to mixing different types of organizational systems
  * Requires precise coordination
  * May lead to conflicts.​

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## ​![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/0036-fe0f-20e3.png) Team-based Organizational
structure

**Team-based Organizational structure** is formed of teams working towards a
common goal while working on their individual tasks. Such teams include
**different specialists**(managers, suppliers, production workers,
technologists, finance specialists) who work toward a common goal while
performing their own specialized tasks.

  

![](/images/upload/Corporate_Structures_8.@x1.png)  

Each team has autonomy and independence and is fully responsible for the
results of its work. Because they're all on the same team and **regularly
interact with each other,** they communicate ideas faster compared with other
types of organizational systems. Further, professionals may reach out to other
departments within the organization for information.

  

**Team Organization structures** have changed the way many industries work
around the world to produce goods and services cooperatively. They are less
hierarchical and have flexible structures that reinforce problem-solving,
decision-making, and teamwork.

### ​[Pros]

  * High employee motivation and involvement;
  * Fast decision-making;
  * Flexibility and adaptability.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### [Cons]

  * Requires compatible teams;
  * Not suitable for all tasks;
  * It is difficult to coordinate the work of different teams.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/0037-fe0f-20e3.png) Network Organizational structure

**A hybrid solution** that combines divisional and matrix types of
organizational systems, their adaptability and unified management of basic
functions. A network structure prioritizes collaboration and positive
relationships more than hierarchy.

  

![](/images/upload/Corporate_Structures_9.@x1.png)  

Compared with other types of organizational systems, networked organizations
do not have a hierarchical organizational chart. Instead, they **make clusters
made up of different departments,** business units, or local offices, which
work together when needed and use the full resources of an organization to
meet customer goals.

  

**A Network organizational structure** is the most beneficial when a company
has many divisional components in different geographic locations. It is a
system that involves interacting with internal and external parties to deliver
a product or service. By focusing on core competencies, each organization can
offer its best products or services to reach defined goals.

### [Pros]

  * Flexible and adaptive;
  * Low costs;
  * Allows to quickly bring new products to market.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### [Cons]

  * Complex control;
  * Limited coordination;
  * Not suitable for all niches.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/0038-fe0f-20e3.png) Process-based Organizational
structure

**The main feature of the Process-based Organizational structure** is the
priority of processes rather than functions. For such a company, business is a
set of processes, strategic plans, and a sustainable system of improvements.
While a strictly functional structure and some other types of organizational
systems often compartmentalize work, a process-based approach prioritizes the
interconnectedness of tasks within the bigger picture.

  

![](/images/upload/Corporate_Structures_10.@x1.png)​​​​​​​​​​​

  

**So, the Process-based structure** is organized to follow a product’s or
service’s life cycle. For example, this organizational structure can be broken
down into R&D, product creation, order fulfillment, billing and customer
services.

  

A Process-based organization **relies on the idea that final products or
services** are the result of a sequence of internal processes. All these
internal processes should be organized as well as possible. The customer
acquisition process can't start until you have a fully developed product to
sell. By the same token, the order fulfillment process can't start until
customers have been acquired and there are product orders to fill.

  

Customer acquisition and order fulfillment are two sides of the same coin,
with one fueling the other in a continuous loop. These processes dance in
tandem, where customer acquisition sets the stage, and order fulfillment
delivers the performance. **Smooth execution requires both processes to be
planned and coordinated.**

### [Pros]

  * Allows to reduce production costs;
  * Increases efficiency and speed;
  * Each project participant understands the importance of their work.​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### [Cons]

  * Possible conflicts between the different process groups;
  * Could cause communication breakdowns.​​​​​​​​​​​

## ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/0039-fe0f-20e3.png) Circular Organizational
structure

**Circular Organizational structure** is based on a democratic hierarchy.
Managers here are not commanders, but leaders. They're at the center of the
organization, spreading their vision outward. Decisions are made collectively
by all members of the organization.

  

![](/images/upload/Corporate_Structures_11.@x1.png)  

Unlike the siloed nature of traditional types of organizational systems, where
departments operate somewhat independently, the circular model visualizes
everyone as i**nterconnected parts of a unified whole.**

  

**A Circular organization** is fostering long-term collaboration and
creativity, intending to empower people. Soft skills, such as attitude,
teamwork, communication, and decision-making capabilities are critical for a
Circular Organizational structure.

  

### [Pros]

  * Information flowing freely across the business;
  * Connecting individuals to the bigger picture;
  * Encouraging employees to collaborate between departments.​​​​​​

### [Cons]

  * Can be confusing, especially for new employees;
  * Unclear reporting lines for new hires.​​​​​​

## ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/1f51f.png) Line Organizational structure

This is one of the simplest and very common types of organizational systems,
consisting of chains, where each level of management has **clear authority
over the next level down.** Decisions go down the chain from the top to the
deputies, then to department heads and specialists. The chain of command
allows each department head to have control over their departments.

  

![](/images/upload/Corporate_Structures_12.@x1.png)  

In simple words, line organizations have clear lines of authority (chain of
command) running from the top of an organization down to the lowest levels.
**Independent decisions can be taken** by line officers because of its unified
structure.

  

Unlike other structures, supportive services do not take place in these
organizations. The main advantage of a line structure can be identified as
**stability to the company.**

### [Pros]

  * Simple interaction;
  * Rights and responsibilities are clearly delineated;
  * High level of discipline and control;
  * Performers have opportunities for career growth.​​

### [Cons]

  * Managers deal with a wide range of issues, which can reduce their focus;
  * The final decisions of specific individuals, including incorrect ones, affect the entire company;
  * There is no communication between performers and higher management levels;
  * Opportunities for abuse of power in a high position.​

## Findings

There are the most common **types of organizational structures,** but there is
no one “right” structure. So, which structure will work best for your company?
To find the correct answer, you should know your company very well, from
current roles and teams to the strategic plan.

  

How are job functions currently organized, and does it foster communication
and productivity? And what about employee growth? Feedback from employees,
leadership and other stakeholders can be very useful in order to **find the
right approach from many types of organizational formats.** But the main goal
of the best (for you) organizational structure is to support your strategic
plans.

  

**Consider this and don't doubt about using different flexible and hybrid
types of organizational framework.** It can change along the life circle and
company development. Find your optimal path that will support your productive
management strategy.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
