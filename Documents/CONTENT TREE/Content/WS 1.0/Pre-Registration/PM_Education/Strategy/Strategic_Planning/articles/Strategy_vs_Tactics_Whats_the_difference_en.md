# Strategy vs Tactics: 
What's the difference?

**Strategy and tactics are two related concepts that are often confused.**
However, in practice, strategies and tactics differ significantly from each
other, and these differences have a strong impact on business processes and
the development of companies. In a business context, this means the specific
actions teams take to implement some initiatives.

  

** _Therefore, this article is devoted to strategy, tactics, their
capabilities, and your prospects from their masterful use._**

## What's the difference between strategy and tactics?

Strategy and tactics are terms that are typically found in a business context.
The point is that many entrepreneurs will agree that business requires a
careful and thoughtful approach. This approach allows us to use **the concepts
of strategy and tactics to manage a company.**

**  
**

**![](/images/upload/strategy_vs_tactics_2_eng.@x1_1.png)  
**

**Understanding the difference between strategy and tactics** is critical to
business success. Strategy provides the overall direction, while tactics are
the specific steps needed to achieve goals. While strategy is the action plan
that takes you where you want to go, the tactics are the individual steps and
actions that will get you there. You can think of the difference between the
strategy and tactics as the strategy being the «what» and tactics being the
«how».

  

We all know the phrases "tactical planning", "business strategy", don’t we?
It's time to **delve deeper into these concepts** and find out the goals,
objectives, capabilities, features, and difference between strategy and
tactics.

### Definition of strategy

**A business strategy is** a high-level, long-term plan aimed at achieving
specific company goals. Strategy determines the company's development course,
its market positioning and competitive advantage.

  

A business strategy**helps a company focus resources** on achieving goals,
make informed decisions, and ensure long-term success.

  

![](/images/upload/strategy_vs_tactics_eng_3.@x1.png)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

  

This requires the following**basic components** of a business strategy:

  * **Vision:** a description of the company's desired future.
  * **Mission:** defining the purpose and values of the company.
  * **Goals:** specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound goals that the company strives for.
  * **Resources:** allocation of human, financial and other resources to implement the strategy.
  * **Leadership:** provide leadership and coordination to implement strategy.​​

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Thereby, strategy is a vital tool for any company that wants to achieve long-
term success. And that's why **developing a business strategy is an ongoing
process** that must be reviewed and updated regularly.

### Definition of tactics

**Tactics in business are** a set of specific actions and methods used to
implement a business strategy. Tactics focus on short-term goals and details,
helping the company bring its long-term vision to life.

  

Business tactics **help a company use resources efficiently,** achieve its
goals on time, and increase competitiveness.

  

![](/images/upload/strategy_vs_tactics_eng_4.@x1.png)  

**Basic elements** of business tactics:

  * **Planning:** developing the specific steps needed to achieve goals.
  * **Implementation:** carrying out planned actions.
  * **Monitoring:** monitoring progress and making adjustments as needed.
  * **Motivation:** encouraging employees to work towards achieving goals.
  * **Communication:** ensuring effective exchange of information between employees.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

If you were to compare strategy and tactics in an organization, more often
you'll find that an organization uses any number of tactics but lacks an
overall strategy. **This is a reminder of how important it is to regularly
review and adjust both strategy and tactics.**

## What makes a good strategy?

**All effective strategies have common features**. These are the signs by
which they can be recognized, and these are also tips on how to build an
effective and promising strategy for your company.

**The characteristics of effective strategies are:**

  1. Compatibility with institutional aims.
  2. Adaptability.
  3. Clarity and understandability.
  4. Resource support.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Each of these characteristics is critical to a truly strong strategy. To

  * Increases the likelihood of success.
  * Strengthens the effectiveness of strategy implementation.
  * Increases employee motivation.
  * Reduces the risk of failure.
  * Protects against distrust of management.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## What makes good tactics?

**As we've learned, tactics are short-term steps** that will help you achieve
smaller goals along the way to executing your strategy. Tactical planning is
the breaking down of a strategic plan into short-term actions. These actions
are successful **if they have the following attributes:**

  1. Consistency with the overall strategy
  2. Flexibility
  3. Controllability

**In addition to these aspects,** successful tactics should also be realistic,
innovative and clearly communicated to all employees. We will take a closer
look at the key features of good tactics that significantly increase the
chances of successful implementation and achieving the desired results.

### {1. Consistency with the overall strategy}

  * Reduces silos between departments.
  * Eliminates ineffective expenses.
  * Minimizes the risk of failure.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### {2. Flexibility}

**Tactics must be** flexible enough to change depending on changes in the
external environment, such as the emergence of new technologies, changes in
the competitive environment or economic crises.

  

**A fairly flexible tactic has the following capabilities:**

  * Increases resistance to change.
  * Builds the ability to respond to new opportunities.
  * Strengthens competitiveness.
  * Reduces the risk of tactics becoming obsolete.
  * Reduces losses from failure to adapt.
  * Minimizes the likelihood of failure.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### {3. Controllability}

**Tactics must be** measurable and controllable. This allows for regular
monitoring of progress and making necessary adjustments.

  

**Controlled tactics provide the following advantages:**

  * Increases efficiency.
  * Expands adaptability.
  * Strengthens the team’s confidence in the correctness of the company’s course.
  * Reduces the risk of deviation from the strategic course.
  * Eliminates ineffective expenses.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Developing and implementing successful tactics **is a complex and time-
consuming process** that requires careful planning, execution, and monitoring.
