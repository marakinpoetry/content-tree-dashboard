# Team Task Management Guide

_As soon as the head of the company realizes that the number of projects is
quite large and continues to grow, it comes to the**effectiveness of task
management for teams.**_

  

One of the effective ways to increase team productivity is**team task
management.** It helps to do more in the allotted time and prevent employee
burnout. We will tell you how to establish a really high-quality task
management.

## Team Task Management

**A project task** is a specific action, the successful completion of which is
a step towards achieving the goal.

When it comes to team task management, it means the manager must find a
**balance between the workload of the team and its effectiveness.** That is,
to distribute the tasks in such a way that all of them are completed on time
and in accordance with the technical requirements, with the employees working
without overtime and too tight deadlines.

## The Importance of Team Task Management

The importance of effective task management cannot be overestimated. The
**success of individual projects** and **business** in general depends on it.

  

If the company does not have task management for teams, the following problems
will have to be faced in the future.

  * **Tasks that no one knows about.** This happens when they were simply talked about or written in the messenger, but there is no record of who should do what and when.
  * **Lost tasks.** If there are several executors of a task, it happens that they pass it on to each other sequentially. Something might happen that the task does not reach the next executor and remains somewhere in a "suspended" state.
  * **Lack of important components to complete the task.** Decomposition is a useful thing in solving large-scale problems. Sometimes it happens though that at the final stage it is not possible to get everything necessary to complete the task, e.g. a team member is not in touch, and no one knows where his work materials are.
  * **Overdue tasks.** Sometimes the intermediate stages are delayed so much that the deadlines of the tasks and the entire project are significantly shifted. It happens that the obtained result is no longer relevant, needs changes and, accordingly, additional resources for them.

If the above phenomena are present in the company, the loss of customer
loyalty and part of the profits is inevitable. **Team task management** is
needed to avoid this.

## What Is Effective Task Management?

Task management can be considered effective, if it allows you the following:

  1. **lack of identical task priorities** for one performer;
  2. a **single source of information** for all employees;
  3. **the ability to track progress** on tasks;
  4. **stability of deadlines;**
  5. adequate **workload** of each team member;
  6. **high quality** of work performed.

## What Are 5 Key Components of Task Management?

Depending on the specifics of the project, the nuances of task management for
teams may change. But usually team task management cannot do without the
components listed below.

  

{Strategic planning} The first step in this process is **to assess the team's
goals** and plan the action tasks that will lead to success.  
  

{Organization of resources} After the strategic goals are set and the progress
plan is drawn up, it is necessary **to assess the available resources.** If
there are enough of them to complete the tasks, you can coordinate people's
activities, appoint people responsible for certain processes and move on.  
  

{Systematic work with talents} When a person does what he likes the most, he
is much more effective. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically pay
attention to communication with each team member to understand their
**aspirations and skills.** This information will help you delegate tasks to
those who can handle them best.  
  

{Communicating the tasks and motivation for their implementation} A formal
order to complete a task is, of course, necessary. But the manager must
explain in detail how this **task affects the project.** It is also very
important to motivate people so that they feel that the work they do is
important and appreciated.  
  

{Constant progress monitoring} In the inspirable success stories it is not
often written about how important it is to constantly monitor the status of
work on tasks, track progress, watch for bottlenecks, etc. When the manager
sees that something is not going wrong, it is possible **to adjust actions in
time** and learn from this experience for the future to avoid making similar
mistakes.

## How Can You Organize Work on Team Tasks?

The experience of leading companies shows that the optimal way for organizing
work with **teamwork task management.** It deals with a number of issues:

  1. **A single working space.** All levels of the company, from top managers to junior specialists, will collaborate in a common environment. This will allow management to clearly see the project status and organize an effective task management planning.
  2. **Establishing cooperation.** When team members across the company are working on tasks to an agreed standard, the alignment increases, positively affecting productivity.
  3. **Clear priorities.** The task manager clearly indicates which tasks are the most important right now and require a priority solution. Therefore, there will definitely be less confusion at work.
  4. **A time-saving automation.** The software allows you to quickly plan team tasks, using, for example, templates for typical and/or repetitive tasks.
  5. **Optimizing remote teamwork.** Wherever employees are, they have access to tasks and can work on them. This is especially convenient for teams that have a time difference.

## Step-by-step: starting to manage team tasks efficiently

First of all, note to yourself that whatever team task management strategy you
choose, at the initial stage of implementation, things will definitely not
happen as easily as you imagine.

  

So, the **main thing is to understand the meaning of collaborative task
management** and the benefits it will bring to the business in the long run.
But approaches and methods can change. **Experiments** are a perfectly normal
tool on your way to success.

  

These may be **the first steps** to effective team task management.

### Describe business processes and digitize everything you can

Even if it seems to you that everything is already clear, and the company is
not large, it should be done as early as possible. The main things to fix are

  * organizational **structure;**
  * work **goals;**
  * **roles, responsibilities** and **tasks** of employees.

When everything is described, you may have to look at the company in general
and certain teams in a new way.

  

After you have a complete overview of your business, start moving towards
**the digitization of processes.** For example, get rid of paper notebooks and
reports in favor of documents on Google drive, that is, implement a kind of
digital transformation.

### Choose the task management tool which suits you most

Above we have given examples of tools that are effective for teams. Each of
them needs to be tested by the manager who will be responsible for integrating
the system into the teams' work. This is important because:

  1. a person must understand the **advantages and disadvantages of trackers** and choose the tool consciously;
  2. after the choice decision is made, it is necessary to convince the employees, i.e., explain what advantages the software offers.

If the company has several teams, it is possible **to involve their leaders in
the testing** and final selection of the tool, this will greatly simplify the
further implementation of the task manager.

### Outline the short-term goal for task management tool integration

Above we have already talked about the importance of task management. But not
every employee may be close to these global goals, besides, they are sometimes
difficult to grasp. Therefore, it is better **to describe the results of the
implementation** that should be aimed for in the short term, for example,

  * **100%** of tasks are recorded in the task tracker, not in chats, mail, etc.;
  * all **communications and file sharing** on the task are done in the task manager;
  * three months after implementing the tool, we have **clear indicators of the time** spent on solving typical problems.

### Implement the functionality step-by-step

It will be better if the **team first transfers the tasks** that were treated
verbally, in messengers or on paper to the task manager and starts working
with them: creating according to the template, delegating, changing statuses
and closing.

  

Once everyone understands the process, you can move on to additional features
such as **prioritization, time tracking, budgeting** etc.

  

There is another implementation option: first some individual employees (or
one of the teams, if there are several) go all the way. And then the process
is scaled to the entire company.

  

**Important!** It may seem impractical to pay for all of a product's features
and only use some of them. In this case,**firstly,** you can use the free
trial version, available from many developers of task managers. **Secondly,**
why not purchase the basic functionality of the service first? It can be
expanded over time to suit the needs of the team.

### Make innovations to a constant topic of discussion

This is the only way to get detailed feedback from employees. Don't limit
yourself to formal monthly questions like "Hey, this task tracker is cool,
isn't it?"

  

At the beginning of the task management system integration in the work of the
company, it is worth **starting a conversation about it regularly.** For
example, in daily and weekly meetings, you can have five minutes to discuss
the**impressions of working with the task manager.**

  

If someone wants to make detailed comments that require more time, discuss a
time that is convenient for all, but in no way disregard the judgment of the
employees.

* * *

**Therefore, managing team tasks has a noticeable impact on work efficiency
and business success. In order to implement this tool in your company easily
you must:**

  * understand what specific benefit it will bring you;
  * choose a task manager;
  * step by step integrate it into daily activities, getting constant feedback from the team.  

**We wish you productive work!**
