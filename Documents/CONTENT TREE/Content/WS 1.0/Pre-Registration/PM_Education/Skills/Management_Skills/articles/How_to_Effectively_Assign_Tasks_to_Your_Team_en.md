# How to Effectively Assign Tasks 
to Your Team

When managers or project managers make mistakes during the task formation
stage, an irreversible chain of events begins: the team or individual members
do not understand the task's objective, do not see the deadlines, and do not
feel responsible for the result.

**  
**

**Oral tasks are non-existent tasks. Document every task in a task manager and
use the SMART approach when defining it.**

## Setting Tasks Using the SMART Technology

Any task should be:

  * **S (Specific)** – clear and specific
  * **M (Measurable)** – measurable
  * **A (Achievable)** – attainable
  * **R (Relevant)** – relevant
  * **T (Time Bound)** – time-bound

​SMART tasks have a simple logic and structure, but most importantly, they
have a clearly defined goal and deadlines.

## How to Set Tasks Correctly

  * Document All Tasks in the Task Manager 

​If a task is assigned orally, in a messenger, or via email, the chance of it
being lost is high. Correspondence in messengers or via email is inconvenient.

  * Create a Task Setting Guide 

​This should be an internal company guide describing the rules for setting
tasks. For example: in what order tasks are taken into work (by priority, by
deadlines, etc.), who can close tasks, mandatory supervisor check before
closing a task, and other options.

  

###### Access to the internal guide within the task manager can be for the
entire team or only for those creating tasks.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Tasks in a Task Manager

Here’s what a properly set task looks like in a task manager. Let’s examine in
detail how to set up a task correctly.

#### ​Write the Task Title

​The title should reflect the essence of the task, be understandable and
concise. It should be written in a way that makes it clear what it is about
without getting into detailed descriptions.

  

[Do] _Create a prototype of the website for client XX._

  

This title answers the questions: What to do? For whom to do it? Additional
information can be placed in the task comments.

  

[Don’t] _Urgent task for Alexander from the marketing department for
Wednesday._

####

  * **Assign Responsibility** ​​​​​​​​​​​​​

​A lack of accountability for results is one reason tasks remain unfulfilled.
The person responsible for completing the task controls the workflow, can
create interim reports, and make changes.

  

If the team has questions about the task during work, the responsible person
will provide answers, more information, or clarify details with the client if
needed.

#### Add Followers or Participants

If a team of several people is working on the task, task followers will
receive notifications about changes via email and in the system. Participants
see the task information and can track its progress.

  

###### During the task, responsibilities can change, and other team members
can join.

####

  * **Set Deadlines** ​​​​​​​​​​​​​

​These can be the final deadline for completing the task or a "start-finish"
timeframe. Clear deadlines allow efficient time management. If the deadlines
are clear, the team works towards the result.

####

  * **Set Planned Expenses** ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

​Determine how much time and money will be needed to successfully complete the
task. The task manager has a "Plan" option where you can specify the number of
hours and the budget for the task, or just one of these.

  

###### Comparing planned and actual expenses during work allows for a quick
response to changes. Team members can use a timer to track the time spent on
tasks.

####

  * **Describe the Task** ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

​Write the task information, its importance, goals, and requirements in the
description window. Write clearly so that the team working on the task and the
responsible person have no questions after reading. The task should be
understandable, important, and measurable.

  

Additional options in the task description window:

  1. File upload
  2. Checklist
  3. Mention team members in comments

​When working on a task as a team, if there’s a request, comment, or question
for a specific team member, mention them in the comment window to minimize the
chances of losing important information.

  

####

  * **Assign Priority, Add Labels and Statuses** ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

​Priority, statuses, and labels are additional options for effectively setting
tasks.

  

**Priority** can range from 1 to 10, with ten being the highest. Usually,
tasks with the highest priority are done first. Priority is assigned when
creating or editing a task.

  
**Statuses and labels** serve as markers for the task's progress and specific
aspects of the work process. A task can have one status and multiple labels.

  

**Example of Labels:**  

  * By type of work: "Installation," "Design," "Revisions"
  * By time characteristics: "April," "September," etc.
  * By quality characteristics: "Very Good," "Super," "Done Perfectly," etc.

* * *
    
    
    Example Task Settings:

  * Create a logo for company XXX.
  * Write a commercial proposal for client XX.
  * Prepare a report for Client XXX’s project for February 2020.
  * Pay for consulting services from Company X.
  * Refine the presentation layout for the sales department.

## ​How to Control Task Completion

​​Using a task manager, you get several effective control tools:

  1. Reports
  2. Calendar
  3. Kanban
  4. Gantt Chart

​In addition to having a responsible person and precise deadlines, you can
control tasks through Reports, Calendar, and Kanban. Reports allow you to
filter tasks by necessary parameters, and the Calendar helps track task
completion by deadlines, priority levels, and other parameters.

  

**Kanban** is a visual representation of task stages on a board. The task
status can be changed during work, and tasks can be moved from one stage to
another using Kanban.

## 4 Typical Mistakes in Task Setting

**[1] ​Lack of Understanding of the End Result**

The team working on the task must understand the final result.

  

What should be the outcome? If the project is the global goal, then each
individual task within the project is an intermediate goal leading to the
achievement of the global one.

  

**[2] Unrealistic Deadlines**

Determine the deadline for each task, considering complexity, the number of
employees involved, team workload, and individual participants at the moment.

  

_**Unrealistic deadlines can lead to two negative scenarios: the task will be
done poorly or not at all.**_

  

**[3] Complex Tasks**

Complex tasks should be broken down into simpler ones. One complex task =
several simple ones. Each task should focus on achieving one goal.

  

**[4] Incomplete**

Information The information for the task should be exhaustive. Consider what
other resources the responsible person might need to start working
immediately.

### Motivate and Ask Questions

  

One important task of a manager or project manager is to motivate the team.
For example: "If we complete this task on time, then...". Motivation can be a
bonus, team outing, or a meeting where the achievement of each team member is
acknowledged.

  

Ask questions during the task: Is the task clear? What difficulties arose?
What needs to be changed and why? The manager’s interest in achieving the
common goal motivates the team to work effectively.

### Request Feedback

The advantage of setting tasks in a task manager is the ability to address a
specific participant rather than the entire team. For example, if ten people
are working on a task and you need to address one person, mention them with @
in the task comments to clarify if everything is clear and if additional
information is needed.
