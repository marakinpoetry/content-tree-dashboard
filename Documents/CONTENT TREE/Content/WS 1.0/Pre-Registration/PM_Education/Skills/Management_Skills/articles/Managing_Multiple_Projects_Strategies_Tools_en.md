# Managing Multiple Projects: 
Strategies & Tools

_**Multitasking** is a leading trend for many specialists, especially project
managers. Running multiple projects simultaneously has become their routine. _

  

 _To run several projects at once effectively one should avoid the most common
mistakes and use special strategies and programs._

## What is project management

A project is often referred to as a way to turn ideas into reality. Usually
the project is started to solve the problem or to use an opportunity. That is
why a **project has:**

  * an idea or a goal;
  * an executive or a team;
  * resources (financial, technical and human resources, as well as time).

To reach a particular goal in a definite period of time, staying within the
given resources, you need **project management.**

**  
**

**Project management** is any activity which is aimed to reach a particular
goal in the most efficient way for the company.

In other words, due to project management problems and challenges turn first
into a detailed plan and then become a successful **case you can be proud
of,** which is due to

  1. risk **analysis** and risk **management;**
  2. optimal **management** strategy;
  3. **implementation** of the ultimate team management method;
  4. **ability** to assign tasks correctly;
  5. **understanding** of checkpoints and the importance of effective feedback.

## Useful skills in project management

To run multiple projects at once within the indicated deadlines and with aimed
results, a **project manager must have many skills.** You have to consider
that such employees very often manage several projects simultaneously. These
can be independent projects or subprojects within one complicated and
ambitious initiative.

  

To organize a multi-project planning and manage several projects at once, a
project manager must have the following**professional experience:**

  

  * **Management techniques** and understanding of situations where each one should be applied. Some prefer the traditional cascade model, others choose Agile. A project manager should be aware of both. 
  * **Teamwork.** A project manager should know how to work with the employees and create a favourable working environment, but it is also important that he can hire new team members, if this is necessary for project success. Besides, newcomers would need good onboarding to become a part of the team as soon as possible.
  * **Basic knowledge in the target area.** Otherwise it can be extremely difficult to understand how well the job is done. For this reason project managers must be well-versed in many technical fields.
  * **Multiple planning.** If a project manager runs more than 2 projects at once, time management skills and ability to create a good working schedule become crucial. For example, if you use sprints, it makes sense to start sprints in different projects on different days. This eliminates chaos in your workflow.
  * **Prioritizing.** Each project has important but not urgent tasks, or tasks which are urgent, but not very important. To prioritize tasks according to their importance for the project progress you can use the simplest tool - the Eisenhower decision matrix. 
  * **Delegation.** You can do everything well and independently only to a certain limit. Then you realize that a day has only 24 hours. So the sooner a project manager gets the importance of delegation skills, the less likely he is to burn down and start making serious mistakes.

## Problems, mistakes and pitfalls of multiple project managing

Companies might have completely different projects, but mistakes are often
very much the same. Let's consider the **most common ones.**

  

###### Assign one person to organize several projects that are at the same
stage of the life cycle

If there are not ten of these projects and they are not too large-scale, but
typical for your company, then the **mistake will not be fatal.**

  

But let’s imagine another situation: it is necessary to carry out an
initiation, that is, to get as much information as possible about the purpose
of the project, to justify why it is relevant right now, and to define
stakeholders. This stage takes a really long time and the further planning and
success of the project depends on it.

  

And if there are three or four such projects at the same time? It is clear
that a person is not physically able to **work well on several projects at the
same time** , so some project will definitely be left behind.

  

To avoid such a situation, you have to consider that a project manager can be
entrusted with more than one project, but they must be **at different stages
of their life cycle.** For example, one is in the initiation, while another is
approaching the completion stage.

  

###### "Closing" all key processes on one employee

Even when a project manager is an extremely responsible person, **force
majeure can happen.** If such a situation occurs and all the key information
is in the head of only one person, it is a disaster. At a certain point team
members will stop understanding what and how to do next.

  

To avoid this, it is necessary to create documents that **clearly describe
tasks** (and even create templates for regular ones), processes and areas of
responsibility.

  

###### The ideal option is when the team has an employee who can substitute
the project manager.

###### Ignoring project management tools or using too many of them

Both options are wrong. Yes, if the projects in management are not
complicated, it may seem that mail and a few documents on Google Drive are
enough.

  

In fact, it only seems so until the moment when it is necessary, for example,
to quickly get an overview of the time spent by any specialist. It turns out
that no one recorded anything.

  

It also happens the other way around, when one program is used **for file
sharing,** another **for communication and tasks** , and a third **for time
tracking.** Eventually, the issue will arise about how to synchronize all this
data.

  

Therefore, at the very beginning of the project, **evaluate its scope,
specifics, form of payment, etc.** This will help you understand whether you
only need a time tracker and, for example, a messenger, or you need a full-
fledged task tracker with Gantt charts, reporting and multiple project
prioritization.

## Multiple project managing strategies

When it comes to running several projects at a time the following
**strategies** can be helpful.

  1. **Set goals and agree on them with the client.** You must have them **written down as detailed as possible.** All parties must understand the goals and confirm their understanding. If someone has an insignificant doubt, formulate the goals again until they are clearly and unanimously agreed by both team and client.
  2. **Understand the scale of projects**. To do this, you need to detail **all the steps to achieve the goals.** The more details, the better. If the plan is very approximate, there will definitely be problems related to a misunderstanding of the scope and additional expenditure of resources.
  3. **Consider risks for each project.** You might find different risks: financial delays, issues with work schedules. The main point is to **consider them in advance** and think of ways to eliminate their effect.
  4. **Create the best teams.** Sometimes there is a temptation to save money and hire an employee with less experience for less money. As a result you spend time and money, while the most simple tasks are performed carelessly. Then you have to make a new team to start from the very beginning or to correct the mistakes of the previous executives. 
  5. **Get all key project information in one place.** You will most likely need a **task manager** to run several projects at the same time. Such a solution will allow you to **have an overview** of what is happening in each project now, and what should happen in the future. So you can see overlaps, problems with deadlines and employees’ workload. 
  6. **Explore projects from a strategic perspective.** Find the project, which is **most important for the company.** Find out the most difficult and time-consuming tasks. Give them the highest priority and start with them, even though it's always tempting to do the easier tasks first. 
  7. **Avoid unreasonable project expansion.** Most often, the project begins to grow with a large number of new details if little time was devoted to planning. Sometimes this situation occurs because of the desire to make the perfect product. But this growth can lead to disruption of deadlines and too large budget. 
  8. **Balance the interests of teams and customers.** At the beginning everyone seems to have agreed on the goals, but during the work, conflicts between developers and customers periodically arise. In this case, the project manager should use his **negotiating skills** and find a middle ground so as not to offend anyone and not harm the project. 
  9. **Avoid micromanagement.** Sometimes it seems that it is important to be aware of everything that is happening with the project. This leads to the fact that the project manager is controlling almost every step of the team members. As a result, **teams are stressed,** lost and unable to work independently. It is better to develop trust and encourage initiative and autonomy. 
  10. **Explain the general plan of work on the project to every team member.** And also do not forget to define the **specific area of ​​responsibility** of every employee. Record all this in writing so that any team member can quickly find the contact person for each issue. 
  11. **Update project statuses regularly.** You should always **know the status of each project.** Sometimes updates are needed almost every day, sometimes weekly status updates are enough. It depends on the complexity of the project and the deadlines. 
  12. **Constantly seek feedback from colleagues.** This is very important, because timely criticism or advice can help **avoid critical mistakes,** the correction of which will cost you time and money. 
  13. **Find options to save money and then reinvest it.** Usually, customers realize how much the budget can increase. If you stay within the smallest budget, and finish the project earlier than promised, then you are likely to get a bonus. It can be invested in the development of employees or purchase of new equipment. That is, in something that will **let the team advance.**
  14. **Don't be afraid to adapt.** Sticking to a plan is important, but sometimes it's worth being flexible in order to **respond to challenges** or problems that arise during the work. It is better to change something tactical to achieve a strategic goal in a different way. 
  15. **Set time limits for projects.** To manage complex projects, a manager must set the time when he is available and specify issues he can be contacted for. 
  16. **Standardize document formats for projects.** It is good if the projects are managed for one customer. Then there is a chance that the project manager will not have to master unknown and/or inconvenient ways of preparing intermediate results and final reporting. If the projects are from different clients, it is recommended to agree on some **unified format of documents** at the beginning of the work. 
  17. **Choose a way to fight procrastination.** Almost everyone faces this phenomenon, especially when there are several projects, and some of them are difficult. You can use the technique used by the co-founder of The Muse, Alex Cavoulacos. He allocates his working time during the day as follows: **1 large** project or task, **3 medium** and **5 small** ones. 
  18. **Organize effective communication.** Without a well-established algorithm of communication with teams, you won’t be able to work efficiently. Therefore, **create team chats** in the messenger that is convenient for you. It is good if it can be integrated with the task manager. With this option, for example, team members can receive reminder messages about tasks with due dates. 
  19. **Automate everything you can.** If there are many calls in the project, and managers cannot always answer them, set up an **automatic callback:** there are special services and scripts to connect them to the contact database or CRM. If there are repetitive tasks, select a task manager where they will be assigned automatically. 
  20. **Evaluate the project after it is completed.** It is very important to make conclusions, think of mistakes that were made and the ways they were handled. It is also crucial to define which steps were most efficient. You will consider this experience while running next projects.
