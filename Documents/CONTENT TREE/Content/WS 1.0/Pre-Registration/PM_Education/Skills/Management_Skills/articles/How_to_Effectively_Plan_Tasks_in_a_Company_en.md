# How to Effectively Plan Tasks in a 
Company

Effective planning is the backbone of efficient resource distribution,
enabling the achievement of set goals.

**  
**

**For instance,** consider a team of five people simultaneously working on ten
tasks. How can you distribute time so that each task is completed on time? How
many tasks can one team member handle simultaneously without compromising
efficiency and quality?

## The Essence of Planning

Planning provides a clear understanding of how much money, time, and team
members are required to work on a single task. Without a plan, the goals for
projects and tasks remain unachieved.

## Principles and Rules of Planning:

### Systematic Approach

​​​​Planning project tasks should be a mandatory condition of the work process
for all departments and teams within the company.

### Flexibility​​​​​​

If project or task data changes during the process, it's crucial to make
timely adjustments. A task manager tool provides the flexibility for each task
to modify deadlines, budgets, teams, and individual participants if necessary.

### Recording

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​This could be recording a deadline, budget, or
planned time expenditures for working on a project or task.

### Accuracy

​​​​​​​​​​​Time and money are two key parameters in planning. Specify the
exact deadline for completing the project or task and the planned budget.

## Planning Work Processes in a Project Management System

A project management system organizes work processes. Create projects and
tasks within the system, specify planned expenditures, record spent time,
monitor team load and individual member contributions.

  

###### How a Project Plan Looks

In the "Plan" window when creating a project, you can specify the planned
amount of time and budget.

### ​Why It's Important to Break a Project into Separate Tasks

​Multiple team members from one or various teams can work on a single project.
Each has their role, and to prevent role confusion, it's important to create
separate tasks within the project.

  

This way, each team member sees information about their task and its deadline.

  

###### How Task and Subtask Plans Look

As with creating a project, when you create a task or subtask, you can specify
planned expenditures in the "Plan" window. If team members use a timer to
record spent time or manually enter actual time and money expenditures, you
can compare and adjust the plan and actual figures.

### ​Deadline

​Set a clear deadline for the project, tasks, and subtasks. Understanding
deadlines allows the team to allocate time properly to complete the work and
achieve the goal on time.

### Planning a Project or Task with a Future Start Date

If the team is busy, but a new project or tasks from a client comes in, you
can add them to the project management system with a future start date.

## Planning Tools in Task Managers:

Visual planning tools for projects and tasks provide access to current
information about team load, task statuses, stages of completion, planned
expenditures, etc.

### Gantt Chart

A visual tool for tracking the work process and plan for a project. Planning
on a Gantt chart includes the start and end dates of a task, planned
expenditures, and task dependencies.

### Kanban

Previously a simple board with colored stickers, today it is a visual tool for
planning and monitoring the work process in a task manager. Like the Gantt
Chart, Kanban allows you to track information on all project tasks, showing
their status, priority levels, and deadlines.

### Calendar

View tasks with upcoming deadlines within the current month. Analyze team
load, adjust task deadlines if necessary due to excessive load affecting
efficiency.

### Morning Digest

Activate the [morning
digest](https://worksection.com/en/faq/notifications.html) to receive daily
emails with information on tasks and subtasks nearing or past their deadlines.
Daily planning can start with analyzing the current team load and the number
of such tasks and subtasks.
