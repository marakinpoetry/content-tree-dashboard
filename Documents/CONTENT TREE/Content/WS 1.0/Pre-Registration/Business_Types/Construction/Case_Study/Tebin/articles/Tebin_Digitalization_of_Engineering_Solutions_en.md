[**TEBIN**](https://worksection.com/blog/digital-engineering-tebin-bim-
technology.html#) — is an international engineering company of enthusiast and
professionals with 10 years of experience. The company provides the customers
with a complex of services in design and development of engineering solutions.

  

**[Alexander NIkitin](https://worksection.com/blog/digital-engineering-tebin-
bim-technology.html#), СЕО of the company:**

## Digitalization of Engineering

### About Building Information Modeling ( BIM )

BIM designing is digital visualization with transformation of engineering data
into a model flexible to handle. BIM is utilized to design buildings, and it
facilitates further construction and operation processes.

###### 3D representation of BIM designing

  

**In other words, BIM provides the following:**

  * Complex 3D modeling (3D display of projects with data);
  * Project management and coordination at the construction/operation stages;
  * Analysis of project solutions and detection of errors;
  * Engineering analysis of building structures, lighting, energy supply, water supply and ventilation;
  * Virtual reality for analysis of project solutions;
  * Model-based specifications of volumes (BoQ).

  

### We habituate our customers to virtual reality. Who benefits from it?

Engineering and construction currently employ outdated project visualization
methods – plan- and scheme-based. The TEBIN team attempts to foster the
development of industry and engineering designs. For this purpose, we accustom
the company’s clients to the **virtual reality technology**.

![](/images/upload/VR700.@x1_1.jpg)  

  

Data exchange, conferences, meetings and discussions occupy half of working
hours of a contemporary specialist. TEBIN avoids such expenditure. Projects
are demonstrated to customers in live representation in the format of VR-
conferences. It enables the customer to review the facility while staying in
his/her office, having just put on the virtual reality glasses.

  

How it looks like:

In the outcome of such conferences, it takes much less time for investors,
contractors and designers to figure out expectations and requirements. The
main advantage for a designer company is that the VR technology makes **it
possible to view design errors in advance**.

  

  

> The world’s leading construction companies use the BIM model for digital
> visualization of prototypes and layouts. It provides real representation of
> the facility.

  

Workplace communication inside the company and correspondence with customers
are held in **Worksection**. Every task is followed by comments below, where
we discuss details of work, share media content and documents. We do not use
email actively any more. In **Worksection** , the communication is fast, the
correspondence and files are always stored under the task.

  

Customers are ready to change, and we introduce tools and technologies
gradually and reasonably. Dealing with customers in TEBIN is transparent due
to the fact that the company’s projects are handled in parallel with handling
customers through Worksection. More and more Western customers are looking in
the direction of industry digitalization and understand the values of
engineering technologies for management in engineering and construction.

  

## Why Worksection

We were looking for a tool which we would integrate in a couple of months,
with a pleasant interface comprehensive for the team. All our team tried
various task trackers, and after some time we came across Worksection on the
Internet. We viewed the video clips, created our account, uploaded a couple of
projects and got amazed that it was so convenient for our company.

  

Worksection started functioning as a mechanism as early as in one month. The
TEBIN team quickly got accustomed to the mode of completing reports, creating
tasks, responding to comments — and this is not only due to the simplicity.

  

**Worksection** lets us know about the direction of project development, what
should be done further and how well we cope with it.

Advancement in projects is updated very quickly. To avoid confusion, all data
are uploaded to Worksection and downloaded from the head. This saves our
nerves and enhances the employees’ productivity.

  

> We are keen on realizing the Agile approach when outlining sprints, and we
> want to follow their execution.

  

## Adaptation to Worksection

The adaptation process was simple. The first thing done by us was dividing
tasks into subtasks.

  

For example, a 3D plan of a customer’s facility is created in several phases.
A separate task is created for visualization. In this task, we create subtasks
for various visualization operations. In the subtask, we have created the
checklist. It features the digitalization phases for our 3D structure. We
cross out each completed stage.

  

**{Checklist} example:**

In the second phase, we **grouped teams in Worksection** by the departments.
Now we create the company’s projects for a particular team. It is easy to hide
projects from teams and customers not involved in them. For instance,
accounting documents will not be viewed by the IT department or by the
customer’s staff.

It is essential that the task list in the task tracker is ultimately simple
and informative at the same time. The task list in Worksection instantly shows
the project to which the task belongs, as well as its priority, labels and
deadline to complete it.

  

**We liked** the ability to use {filters} provided in Worksection. We can see
the workload of employees and figure out who is overloaded and who idles time
in the office under air conditioning in a summer day.

  1. Filter menu by employees;
  2. Task timeframe.
  3. Tasks, priorities and labels.

  

#### Discipline prevailed — the outcome of Worksection integration in TEBIN.

The team got promptly accustomed to Worksection-based work procedures. Now,
once a specialist arrives at his/her workplace, he or she immediately opens WS
and knows what he needs to do and the sequence in which tasks should be
closed. All questions and answers have been relocated to be found in comments
to tasks.

  

  

## Mobile application

Mobile application was a key factor in selecting a project management system.
It is very convenient when the whole task list is always with you in your
pocket. You needn’t carry your laptop or paper sheets in your hands all round
the office.

Many of our specialists answer from their smartphones. The functions are
almost the same as in the PC version, except for the kanban board. You may
create new subtasks, add comments, upload files, receive push notifications
and track the time by using the time tracker.

  

The last updated data are available [offline]. They include lists of projects
and tasks, personal contacts and the personal notebook. It is so nice that the
application is updated and improved so often.
