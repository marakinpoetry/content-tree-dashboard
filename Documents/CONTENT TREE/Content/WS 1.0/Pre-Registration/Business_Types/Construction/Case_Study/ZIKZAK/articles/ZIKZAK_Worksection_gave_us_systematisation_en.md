# ZIKZAK:
Worksection gave us systematisation

ZIKZAK is a dynamic and committed group of architects and interior designers
who love the design and the creative process. Their experience and constant
research of trends allow them to meet expectations and translate a bold idea
into non-standard design solutions. The design studio has been on the market
for over 5 years and now their team consists of more than 20 designers and
architects.

  

  

## How did you come to systematize the projects

  

This story in our company has been going on for a long time. It all started
after a year of work with Excel files (like all of them). For each project
there was a separate **Excel file in which we set the schedule.** This turned
out to be very inconvenient.

  

  

**For example:** if the project term is shifted or a new task is added, it was
necessary to manually paint all squares throughout the project path. It was
time-consuming and inefficient.

  

Later, an **Excel file was added, where the labour costs for the projects**
were recorded. Each new month was a new file. And every month we counted
manually how many and which squares were involved in each project.

**We counted the hourly wages in Exce** l, but this was more tied not to the
hour, but to the day. For example: we have rounded up labor to a day or half a
day.

  

But when there were too many projects, we started looking for another
solution. We tried different systems: Asana, Trello, Worksection. We’ve
stopped at Worksection and were happy with our choice.

  

  

## What tasks should the task manager solve

  

#### We set ourselves several tasks:

  1. Control the timing of the project. 
  2. Control the project budget.
  3. Control the labor costs for the project .
  4. Lead the project on schedule.

  

  

  

## What has the Worksection given to your company

This gave us systematization. Now we are developing business processes,
transforming them into projects in Worksection and monitoring how the process
corresponds to the plans.

  

  

### Which Worksection features did you start using right away

**The first stage** was creating projects manually inside the Worksection. We
set task after task and described each new project anew.

**The second stage** — We made template projects and just copied the tasks
from there.

  

Now we are using the API: we generate projects from Excel, where the standard
execution algorithm is already described. This allows us to store a
centralized grain from which the project «spreads» within the Worksection.

  

  

## How do you work with projects in Worksection

We have several standard projects, but changes are made to them every time. We
upload planned project data to Worksection, and then the team can make changes
that could not have been foreseen at the stage of project planning . It is
very convenient to do this in Worksection: you can always add a task or delete
an unnecessary one.

  

We have a rule: the employee does not close the task, but rather marks it as
completed, so that everyone has time to contribute their labour. At the end of
the day, the project manager closes all tasks as completed.

  

## How do you use time tracking in Worksection

We calculate the time and budget. Our goal is to track the actual labour
input, so that we can build a more realistic time frame into the project.

The staff easily mastered the function. The only difficulty is to enter labor
costs on time and not forget about it.

  

  

## Do you use reports in Worksection?

Yes. We make a report on labor costs and see if the actual data correspond to
the planned ones.

We have a rule: the team leader can set tasks. Initially, the manager receives
the already formed schedule in the Worksection. The manager can make changes
to the project, can close and open tasks.

  

The rest of the project participants contribute labor costs at the end of each
working day. As a result, we get a complete picture of the project.

  

  

### Do you use email or messenger for Worksection notifications?

We link the Worksection to email. Notifications about tasks to be performed on
the current day are sent to every employee in the morning. If desired,
employees bind notifications to the messenger they use.

#### We always recommend Worksection to those companies and friends who want
to systematize their internal processes.
