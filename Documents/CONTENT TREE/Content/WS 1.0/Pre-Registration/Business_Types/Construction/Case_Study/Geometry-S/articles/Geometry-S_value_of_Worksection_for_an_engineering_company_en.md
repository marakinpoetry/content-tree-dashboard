# Geometry-S: value of Worksection for 
an engineering company

**Oleg Samchyk,** CEO of GEOMETRY-S, shared with us how his team migrated from
Bitrix24 to Worksection in just a week, what main tasks the project management
system helps to handle and what is the benefit of Worksection for an
engineering company.

#### Reference:

[**GEOMETRY-S**](https://geometry-s.com/) is a Ukrainian company that designs
engineering networks of civil and industrial buildings using BIM technologies
(information modeling). The Geometry-S team has been working on the market
since 2012.

**Why did you decide to implement a project management service?**

The system was actually introduced in 2017. Our team was gradually growing, as
well as the number of projects we were managing at the same time, so we
realized that **Google spreadsheets were no longer suitable.** This is how we
started working with Bitrix24.

## How did you migrate from Bitrix24?

The process of switching from Bitrix24 to Worksection **took up to 1 week.**
Some difficulties arose during the migration of tasks due to their large
number (more than 8,000), so it was necessary to clean up Bitrix before
migration, delete all old tasks and leave only relevant ones for current
projects.

Our team, which currently includes 15 engineers and about 10 contractors, is
well-coordinated and therefore **fully supported the transition.** It took
several days to set up stages, tags and user accounts. It is also worth noting
that the adaptation was significantly quicker due to the demonstration of the
features and settings of Worksection. In just half an hour, we received
answers to all our questions.

## How does Worksection help in your work?

The main project tasks have fixed budgets, so it is very convenient to see the
financial reporting of the project, like what budget has been planned, how it
is distributed, and how much is currently left. Also, for some projects
(mainly foreign) we have **hourly payment,** so we also use tracking. We can
set an individual hourly price for each user (for example, if we have a
student on a trial period), which is also convenient.

  

And the most important thing is the task history: you can open the archive at
any time and find everything you need in the comments. Our entire company is
connected to Worksection and **all work communication takes place there.**

Therefore, what I would like to add is a project chat, because sometimes the
questions refer to the project in general, not to specific tasks. But we also
found a solution - we create a separate task called "chat" in the project.

## What is the value of Worksection for an engineering company?

We are a project office, so our projects include the entire **cycle of
development of engineering networks** and architectural objects, from
collecting initial data to approval of project documentation in all expert
institutions.

  

The full cycle of the project involves a large number of tasks. Some may
proceed in parallel, while others only sequentially, and accordingly, a shift
in the deadlines for one task in this case affects the deadlines of the entire
project. Here we use a **Gantt chart:** we connect the tasks, adjust them in
the process and see the real state and the real finish date. This allows us to
avoid "surprises" and make decisions in advance.

We also involve clients to projects in the system, in particular for projects
with hourly rates. The client can see the tracking, participate in the prompt
discussion of issues directly in the comments to the tasks, approve and even
independently create new tasks for further work. It is a completely
**transparent communication system** that reduces routine work and offers the
manager more opportunities for strategic issues.  
  
It is very convenient that the system has **integration with Telegram.**
Currently, 90% of communication in tasks is conducted precisely through the
Telegram bot.

## Do you have internal rules for using Worksection?

Yes, we have a number of internal **corporate regulations,** in particular
regarding Worksection: requirements for naming tasks, filling in initial data
(time, labor costs, budget), Kanban stages and the person responsible for the
stage at which the tasks “move” in the process, as well as rules for closing
and accepting tasks, etc.

## Would you recommend Worksection to other companies?

Definitely! If you **want to grow,** sooner or later you will come to the
issue of implementing a project management system. So why not do it now?
Especially when there is such a cool Ukrainian product.
