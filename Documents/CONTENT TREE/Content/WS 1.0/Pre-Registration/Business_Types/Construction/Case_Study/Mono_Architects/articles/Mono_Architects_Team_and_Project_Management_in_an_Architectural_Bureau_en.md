# Mono Architects:
Team and Project Management in an 
Architectural Bureau

## About the company:

  * Architectural bureau;
  * **More than 10 years** in the market;
  * More than **70 completed projects** and 22 awards;
  * **17 persons** in the team;
  * **Customers:** LUN SkyWind Group, Kan etc.

Since 2009, the **[Mono Architects](https://monoarc.com/) team** have been
developing architectural designs for individuals and international companies.
Mono designs private residential spaces, showrooms for major brands and
lobbies of business centers.

  

The main work objective of [**Mono Architects**](https://monoarc.com/) is to
make premises functional. Layouts are designed from “cubic units” in three-
dimensional spaces. Premises are divided into areas with different intended
purposes. As a result, we provide the customer with an integral, monochrome
and useful interior.

  

> "Usefulness, strength and beauty” form the unique secret of project success
> in Mono Architects.

##  How was Worksection introduced?

### Planning the work and managing the team with a single tool

  

Before Worksection was introduced, project stages were tracked manually, by
means of **messengers, mail or telephone.**

At the stage of team development when the number of projects and people
increased, we realized that we needed a program for project management in
construction. Worksection meets all criteria. Being simple, it pacifies chaos
in communication and provides all functions necessary to manage major
projects.

  

In Mono, all projects are divided into 4 stages with tasks and subtasks having
various degrees of complexity and importance. Every task, even the smallest
one, has a deadline, responsible person and priority. It is impossible to hold
such structure in mind if the team includes more than 2 active projects.

  

> Worksection assists in building logics and sequence when you work **on 10 or
> more projects simultaneously.**

###### List of project tasks

  1.  _Ordinary tasks;_
  2. _Task with enclosed subtasks;_
  3. _Subtasks._

_  
_

> _If tasks are not fixed in a task tracker, important project details are
> overlooked._

  

##  How WS is useful for architects?

###

  * _Checklists_

Checklists constitute a simple tool in the form of lists with subtasks. It is
convenient to break down one large task into small items. Completed items are
crossed out.

###

  * _Priorities_

To determine priorities, we hold weekly team planning meetings. Then the
results of discussions are easily transferred to Worksection. Priorities from
1 to 10 may be assigned to each task.

###

  * _Templates_

For instance, tasks for developing a functional model of a facility are
included in our every architectural design project. There are many tasks
repeated by stages.

  

If only task contents change, we use templates. It is convenient if stages are
repeated in each new project. We simply create a new project for a new
customer, but similar tasks are set through the templates.

  

  

  

###

  * _Privacy_

If it is necessary that the customer should not see details in development
stages, we create a separate directory in Worksection, which is available to
the customer, where we transfer all files to the customer and conduct
discussions.

## Time tracker in designing

Delays are normal for large projects. The company always knows who causes such
delays if it counts its time. At the end of a business day, employees indicate
in Worksection the amount of time consumed for work on certain tasks.

  

  

WHY TIME SHOULD BE COUNTED?

  

Time count is necessary for business. It makes it possible to determine tasks
problematic for the team and resulting delays. To do so, we conduct **hourly-
rate** for tasks to understand the amount of time consumed, give or take.

  

> Time tracking is useful to maintain discipline and to analyze the team
> efficiency.

  

##  Handling projects with customers:

### What is the procedure of customer communication?

On average, we handle 12-15 projects simultaneously. Private customers may use
only chat messengers, and, at the same time, they do not want even to read
emails. Most often, customers themselves suggest using management
applications. It concerns large projects involving many teams.

  

**We handle all our active projects, whether with or without customers, in
Worksection.**

If the customer is ready to use a project management system, we add such
customer in a new project as a customer company.

###### FAQ: [How to add a customer’s
company](http://worksection.com/faq/client-communication.html#q618)

  

By adding a customer, we restrict access to the company’s confidential
information. The customer’s team views only tasks in the project assigned to
it. At the same time, they have no access to the “Reports” section of our
company.

  

The customer may monitor the status of work, receive notices, set tasks,
participate in discussions and share information.
