# Serhii Huzenko: how Worksection 
helps to optimize the work of a 
company with 250+ people

**Serhii Huzenko,** CEO & Owner of [**Wezom**](https://wezom.com/), shared his
experience of building his own company and working in war conditions, insights
into the organization of processes in Worksection, as well as advice on how to
create a successful company of 250+ people.

### About the company:

**WEZOM** is a well-known player in the global IT market, whose clients
include John Deere, Aptive, Cooper & Hunter, Toyota Material, Roshen and many
others. Over 23 years, WEZOM has successfully implemented **more than 3,500
projects.** The company specializes in various sectors including logistics,
oil and gas, supply chain, real estate and e-commerce. The WEZOM team was one
of the **top 100 web development** and services companies in the US in 2023.

## About the Western market and work during the war

Before the full-scale invasion began, we had certain goals regarding Western
customers. We had classic methods of lead generation, including website, SEO
traffic, paid advertising, etc. And then - calls with the customers.

When the full-scale invasion began, we started working with a more or less
targeted customer base that I had once acquired. Living four of us in one
apartment (it was safer), we had been calling potential clients for 8 hours a
day. In total, there were about **60 Zoom calls** with the presentation of our
services. The problem was that the customers did not know us at all, so the
conversion rate was low. So we went the following way: provided a free
Discovery Stage and held a few more calls. This is how clients saw our work
and after that began to buy services.

## How did the company come to Worksection?

We found Worksection pretty quickly and didn't even hesitate. We searched for
a CRM for a very long time, tested a lot, and with **Worksection - we found it
and bought it.** We assign tasks in the system, especially for internal
projects, on a daily basis because there are a lot of cool tools that we enjoy
using. We also give access to our clients if necessary.

## How to "accustom" employees to the time tracker?

This was a problem, and still is, to some extent. We have an accounting
software that **" pulls" data on time spent from Worksection** for a certain
period. After that, the managers open the report for each department and see
the fact sheet for hours worked.

This way, the manager can see the time the employee spent for work. If it is
less than planned, the **manager finds out the reason** directly from the
employee. It is convenient to monitor this during the month, because if the
malfunction "emerges" at the beginning of the next month, it entails losses.
But if there is still some time left before the end of the month, then the
employee can complete the required number of hours, and thus reach the planned
profit values, marginality, etc.

## How to build a company of 250+ people?

Everything was created on one's own mistakes, of course. Knowledge is needed
to run a company, but **the most important thing is people and their skills,**
so I and all the employees at Wezom do our best to make the customer
satisfied. And we are all human, so humanity and customer care should be
invested in the product and work.

  

**The law of success** is perseverance over a long period of time, trials,
errors, actions. That's the only way something can work. The problem is that
**99% of people are not ready for this.** Wezom is 24 years old, but I learned
to make money about 19 years after it was founded. I had mixed thoughts about
quitting and going to a place where I could earn 10 times more with my skills.
Maybe someone else in my position would have done it faster, but it took me 19
years to understand how things work and persevere.

## “We never intended to stop using Worksection…”

We've never thought of stopping using Worksection, and we're not thinking
about it now. **It has soul** and I enjoy working with your system, as all my
250 people do.
