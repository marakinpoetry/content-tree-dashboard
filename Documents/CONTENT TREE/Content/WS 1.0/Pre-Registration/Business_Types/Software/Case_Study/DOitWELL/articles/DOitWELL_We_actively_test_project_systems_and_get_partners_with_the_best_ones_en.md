# DOitWELL: “We actively test project 
systems, and get partners with the 
best ones”

Recently, the Worksection team announced a [Partnership Program
update](https://worksection.com/en/blog/partners_update_2023.html), which will
allow our partners to grow faster, increasing their profits and helping other
companies to effectively manage teams and projects.

  

One of our partners is [**DOitWELL**](https://doitwell.ua/en/), the leading
company for quality control of sales departments in Ukraine. **Yulia
Kishynka** , co-founder of the DOitWELL company, and **Olena Toptunenko** ,
business analyst, specialist in the implementation of project systems, talked
about the experience of integrating various services for the client, the
advantages of implementing Worksection and building internal rules for working
with the client.

## Tell us about DOitWELL and how the company started

DOitWELL started 7 years ago as a **strategic marketing agency.** We were
always focused on the client, listening to what Ukrainian companies currently
need. Requests changed over time and so did we, adding services and changing
formats, and for 3 years now we have been **DOitWELL** _360° sales: do sales,
do service, do business._

###### From DOitWELL website

###### We have come to a 360° format around sales and work with all aspects
that affect the company's sales.

Our team studies the sales business process, optimizes it and automates it
with CRM systems, studies the customer's way, establishes interaction between
sales departments and executive departments of the company, audits the quality
of work with the client, and collects feedback from customers.

## What do integrators do and what are the requests of your clients?

Right now we are focusing on **sales automation** and companies are coming to
us with a request to integrate CRM systems to track information on leads.

  

But the integrator needs to understand the company's processes as a whole, so
as not to create a CRM system for the client that is far from reality, which
he will not be able to scale or use at all. Therefore, we analyze the client's
path in the company and, if necessary, connect additional services that allow
not only to accept a request from the client, but also to provide a high-
quality service, without losing information to transfer the client from the
sales department to the executive department.

  

And often it's just about project systems that we actively research, test, and
**get partners with the best, like Worksection.**

  

In such a collaboration, we are as useful as possible for our client.

## Tell us about the experience of integrating services, in particular
Worksection, for a client

We recently **implemented a CRM system and Worksection for a law company.**

  

Client request was to implement an easy system for processing potential
clients and managing projects with the possibility to work not only in the
office, but also "on the run" between court sessions. The emphasis was
precisely on the **organization of the work of lawyers** as well as easy and
prompt interaction with the sales department.

###### Project Dashboard in Worksection

  
The highlight of the request was the fact that the lawyers had no previous
experience of any services for managing projects and, accordingly, the new
tool could cause rejection. And who wants to argue with lawyers?!))

  

A complex ERP system overloaded with functionality, both for the sales
department and for project management, was abandoned immediately.

  

We chose the laconic Pipedrive for the sales department and the lightest and
**most visually understandable Worksection** for project management.

## What did the client get as a result of implementing Worksection?

Due to the flexible settings of access rights and the company structure in
Worksection, we were able to distinguish between different departments of
lawyers so that the head of the department saw the projects and tasks of his
lawyers, and each of the lawyers had access only to his projects and tasks.
Considering the confidentiality of the legal information of each project, this
was very important.

**Worksection has a great integration with Pipedrive.** We implemented the
creation of a task in Worksection upon winning a contract in Pipedrive without
any customizations and involvement of programmers.

###### In Worksection, you can integrate the service with other CRM systems.
Learn more about integrations [here](https://worksection.com/en/blog/crm-
integrations-2023.html).

  

At the same time, the integration takes into account which service was sold by
the sales department, and the task is created for the head of the legal
department responsible for this service. The client's data, necessary for
further work with him, is automatically added to the task.

  

###### The correct organization of the legal project management algorithm in
Worksection allowed the company manager to easily monitor the status of each
client and his legal case in each of the departments due to Kanban boards.

**The mobile version of Worksection** allowed lawyers to make specific notes
and track tasks even when not in the office. So we didn't have to argue:)

## What is most important to you in the partner service you are integrating?

DOitWELL is a very customer-oriented company. We build a non-conveyor
relationship with the client and pay much attention to the technical support
of our clients. We build internal rules so that we are always there and find
solutions for users of our integrated systems as quickly as possible. After
all, this is **our reputation capital in the services market.**

  

Our main expectation from partner services is a **high level of technical
support.** And Worksection made us very happy about this. We have a dedicated
Worksection support specialist who is always available (even after hours...
there were situations when we had to check this as well). And he really finds
solutions. This is extremely valuable for us!​​​​
