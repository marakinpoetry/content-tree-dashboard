# SPLIT Development: “Worksection 
helped us understand where we were 
losing business”

Together with **Ivan Tryhub** , co-founder and CEO of [**SPLIT
Development**](https://splitdev.pro/) , we discussed the formation of his
company and the specifics of projects, the advantages of Worksection compared
to Jira, as well as the problems of a fixed price.

## **Tell us about your company**

SPLIT Development was **founded in 2019.** I am the CEO of the agency. Our
team is doing design and e-commerce. Now it's more **Shopify** and
**Wordpress,** but we're gradually expanding to **Node.js** as well. We have
almost no clients in Ukraine, so we work with the Western market.

We started working together with the co-founder of the company, **Dmytro
Karpov,** and we realized that we do not want to hire expensive specialists at
the beginning, because at the very start it "kills" the business a little.

  

In general, I was a front-end developer, so we taught our acquaintances and
friends the front-end, and that's how we started working with the first
customers. I did sales, led projects and helped the guys by checking their
code.

  

But **we quickly expanded,** started to get projects, and hired a project
manager. With these steps, after about a year and a half, we got Shopify. And
now the Shopify development team has grown to 11-12 people.

## What tools did you work with before Worksection?

At first, we worked with **Trello,** the free version with 12 projects
available, but because of a rather **reduced functionality,** we wanted to
come to something more stable. Then we worked with **Jira.** But Jira has
become a little **expensive,** as the team began to scale. Besides, it also
had limited functionality.

  

For example, we all work with a tracker, but there is no tracker there. So
once a friend of mine (also an agency owner) **recommended Worksection.** We
had an intro, listened to everything and liked it.

###### Project Dashboard in Worksection

## Why did you choose Worksection?

Because **Worksection has very cool features.** For example, time tracking.
When we first started working with the tool, I began to analyze how much time
the design department, the Shopify department, and Node.js spend on projects.
And when I converted all this into how much we should receive, the numbers I
had were higher than what we actually received. Therefore, let's say,
**analysis appeared.**

  

It is also very convenient that in Worksection you can **appoint a responsible
person for an entire section at once** , who will be responsible not for a
specific task as a whole, but for a certain stage.

**For example,** the developers moved the task from one stage to the "Ready
for QA" stage, but forgot to appoint a tester. The tester then cannot add time
there, because it's not “his task”. But when the task is transferred between
stages and the responsible person is changed automatically, it's cool.

  

And if we compare our work now with how we worked with Jira, I can say that
**Worksection is more convenient:** convenient time analysis, reports. For us,
this is the best. It offered many useful features, and it helped us grow and
understand where we were losing in the business.

## Fixed-price problems

For a while we had been working with a fixed price, but there are a lot of
difficulties with this approach. For example, we can start a project and break
it into stages. We are completing the first phase and starting the second.
Then the client sends corrections to the first stage and we make them,
finishing the second stage. But we can't get paid until we make the first one
perfect .

  

Now **we work more at an hourly rate.** At the beginning of the work, we
always provide the client with an estimate, noting that the expenses may be
higher or lower. Because we cannot calculate perfectly how many hours we will
spend in the end.

  

Our developers and designers **work with a tracker,** managers do not track
time. Because you can count the working hours of a developer and a tester, but
not the time of an accountant, for example.

## Where does the team communicate about projects?

We communicate more in **Slack.** But if there are any questions about the
tasks, then we'd rather write **comments in the Worksection,** so that it
doesn't get lost in the Slack chat later.

  

For example, something has changed in the design. The client saw the design,
he liked everything, but he looked on the website and decided that some button
should be a different color. Such details, where the client makes changes, are
recorded in the Worksection, that is, in the comments or in the task
description, so that the tester can see it during the inspection and
understand why the site differs from the layout.

## When should teams implement a system like Worksection?

The management system should be in place from the very beginning. We had it
from the very beginning, we just didn't know about Worksection.

  

Some teams simply use Trello, for example. But as the team grows, you look for
some other solutions. For us, **Worksection is "price-quality"**, i.e. not too
expensive, like Jira, and even more functionality just for us.
