# Coderiver: 
We Make People Happier with 
Desktop Publishing and Worksection

### [Coderiver](http://riverco.de/?fbclid=IwAR0Sb8KQ8P9_n3hIgk6xwaqgudYRo-
xEnix7EEaSyLHFsIXCNfH34QGqH9U) provides sophisticated desktop publishing
services. We cooperate with the major studios of Ukraine and with numerous
foreign customers. More than 20 highly-qualified developers work for our
company. But, despite such small number, we are absolutely in need of a high-
quality communication service.

  

  

It is not a secret for big companies that a correctly set technical assignment
with continuous communication is a key to success in a team absolutely at all
levels. But our experience is an evidence that it is all about not only big
companies with large personnel, but also about small ones.

  

  

> 20 persons work for us, and Worksection is a great aid to cope with the
> chaos happening in the office at times.

  

###### It is absolutely important for us to do everything to the highest
standard, and the main thing is to keep to deadlines and to satisfy the
customer. Imagine that you are always compelled to run from one department to
another in order to solve issues and problems, or messages are received by
mail every day concerning various matters in different projects. In such case,
even with the best settings possible, you might deliver your project only two
years later. What customer would appreciate it?

  

In particular, checklists are specifically essential for us. They facilitate
the desktop publishing process when you need to enter and remember a lot of
things. With such tricks, we make all corrections quickly and effectively, and
our customers always remain satisfied. And it is the main aspect for us.

  

  

Worksection makes it convenient to hold the finger on the pulse, to have all
data collected at the same location not to lose it, especially when 3-5
persons work on a project.

  

## Positive points

  1. **Definitely checklists.** They simplify and facilitate controlling some aspects which are important for you in particular. Thus you do not distract other employees, communicating for business only. But at the same time, you are always aware of your individual tasks. 
  2. **Ability to set deadlines and to time the work.** This is an essential point because you see at once when you should submit a certain piece of work. It enables you to distribute time wisely, but the main thing is your ability to see how much time you spend on tasks. Therefore, next time it will be easy to forecast approximate costs. It substantially facilitates dealing with customers and meeting the existing deadlines. 
  3. **Convenient and user-friendly interface.** When you always bustle about desktop publishing and development, you can evaluate this factor quite adequately. It is important not only to communicate and set tasks, but to do it in a simple and comprehensible way.
