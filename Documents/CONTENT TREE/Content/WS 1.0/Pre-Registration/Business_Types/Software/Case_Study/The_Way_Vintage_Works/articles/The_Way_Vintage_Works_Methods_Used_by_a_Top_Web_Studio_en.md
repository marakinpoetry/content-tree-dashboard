# The Way Vintage Works:
Methods Used by a Top Web Studio

## Facts about the Vintage Company:

  * 11 years of work
  * 70 international awards
  * 40+ active projects
  * Team consisting of 65 persons

###  

### Evgeniy Kudryavchenko, the ideologist and co-founder of the Vintage Web
Production studio, shares his secrets of project management.

  

## How the work process is structured

Our company operates based on a fixed cost model. It means signing a contract
with a customer to specify the number of planned hours and other resources.
However if the customer has board chairmen or other management groups, our
experience dictates us to double the duration of work.

  

> If our customer has a board of directors, out time consumption will increase
> one-and-a-half times.

Our reality prevents us from selling out the teams appointed. In the studio,
the specialists may be involved in several projects imultaneously to avoid
situations where the designer goes on vacation and the project stops.

  

## How projects are managed

### Architecture of projects and tasks

The architecture of our typical project is strict and not subject to change.
We have templates developed for the basic processes in Worksection: they are
simply copied with deadlines shifted to fit the actual project. The new
project involves a team which may consist of different specialists. Tasks are
distributed to them.

  

All typical tasks are entitled with template-based similar names in all
projects. This is done to enable any project or sales manager to figure out
any project quickly.

  

![](/images/upload/vintage_tasklist_x1.@x1.png)  

  

Additionally, all tasks are segmented and labeled according to the following
principles:

• by the type of work to be carried out: “prototype”, “design”, “front-end”,
“back-end”;

• by the task source: “plan” (planned task), “bug” (error correction task),
“feature” (customer-specified rework).

  

![](/images/upload/vintage_marks_x1.@x1.png)  

  

To divide tasks, we mark them with labels. It is done for us to be able to
understand at the end of the project whether we kept to the schedule or spent
more time on reworking the customer’s corrections, as well as the number of
errors made by the executor. Such information, when accumulated, is of great
value for analysis.

  

That is why task segmentation with labels is primarily an analysis tool for
all managers. Even if the project manager gets into a project of another
person, such time distributions as “Plan”, “Bug” and “Feature” will prompt him
to understand the nature of that project: promo, portal, e commerce, corporate
or personal website. And the distribution of time consumption will inform the
PM (Project Manager) about the project customer – whether it is a bureaucratic
corporation or a private individual, because, for instance, corporations
usually spend a lot of time on corrections and reworks.

  

As for the specialists, they enjoy watching their statistics, such as total
time consumption, and exactly the items on which their time was consumed. It
encourages them to improve their productivity.

  

Such time consumption details enable Vintage to conduct continuous cyclic
analysis based on retrospectives and to improve work processes on a regular
basis.

  

> It works like a thermometer:  
> you get into the project and see the situation in it, its nature and the
> type of the project customer

### Time and payroll accounting

At a certain point, we wanted to introduce a system of grades for our
employees: junior, middle and senior. Such system would enable them to
understand their prospects. To do so, we basically had to introduce time count
in Worksection to track the time consumed by specialists to solve typical
tasks. It was not easy to start time count, and this process lasted for about
two months.

  

Perhaps not always does it work perfectly, but the overall result satisfies
everybody – both the employees and the senior managers!

  

If a task is not set in Worksection, it may not be done, because the time
consumed for the work will not be recorded anywhere.

The specialists of our web studio enter the time consumed for a task in the
task manager. The task labels indicate exactly time-consuming items in a
project, they enable us to correct the existing tasks and to set new ones.

  

![](/images/upload/Vintage_timetracker_x1.@x1.png)  

  

The employees’ salaries are transparent, being accrued by their grades based
upon time tracking. The top managers’ salaries depend on the KPI of the
activities in their respective departments.

  

## How work processes are systematized. Or why not Excel?

We have overcome a way to building the system processes. When the team was
much less numerous, we were diligently fighting with Excels, mails, planning
meetings, kanban lists. At a certain point, our web studio faced a crucial
necessity to find a task manager because our team had grown considerably, and
the number of projects had increased. Each department was using something
detached. Initially, the programmers and layout specialists used Jira, but,
since they had to communicate with the designers, their communication flew in
a free creative form, and soon it entangled conflicts and misunderstandings.

  

We needed an effective tool to systematize communication and task setting,
which would satisfy both creative designers and more “formal” programmers.

  

## Difficulties in selecting a task manager

To implement the purposes and tasks of Vintage, we tried a lot of various
frameworks and programs. The main difficulty in the choice is to adapt the
team to a definite tool rather than to make the choice “functional”.

  

> Even if the top managers say: “So, from tomorrow everybody will be working
> through such product, otherwise you will be fired” - it will not work out.

Any task management tool should be friendly. But no matter how good the
product is, people will not start using it on their own. We have come up with
a conclusion that a person is needed to support the introduction. Such process
may be called “hooking”, but that is in a good sense. Even useful and
necessary habits require habituation. And in 2 months, nobody will refuse from
the product. When people get accustomed to it, evaluate the possibilities,
understand the extent of simplification in their life, nobody will imagine
their work without it!

  

> It is currently habitual for us – the same way as to wash hands before
> meals.

##  

##  Why we have opted for Worksection

We have been handling projects in Worksection for several years already. As
for me, I greatly appreciate this product for my ability to unify different
specialists to work on a common project.

  

We had tried a lot of solutions, such as Jira, Bitrix, Asana, Basecamp, Teamer
and Planfix. Worksection. Why?

**  
**

### **The main criteria are simplicity and clarity.**

If everything is simple and clear for me as the owner, the team, in turn, will
figure it out quickly. I was also attracted by a powerful feed of comments
where it was so easy to place checklists, files, screenshots, videos, to tag
people and to hide comments.

> The most difficult thing in a task manager is to get people start using it!

Perhaps, at the time of the choice, we lacked some functions useful for
particular specialists, but it did not affect our choice. It is so nice that
the product is regularly updated. Once we got to a point where some
functionality became necessary, — and at that point, Worksection got upgraded
with new features. It was cool.

  

All our employees involved in production (programmers, layout specialists,
account managers, designers) work through Worksection and use it as a task
manager for the web studio. Only the sales department operates Hubspot and
uses Slack for communication.

  

The finance department and programmers use their field-specific programs with
necessary specific functionalities.

  

> Even for routine office tasks, such as buying flowers or ordering pizza, we
> have a dedicated branch in Worksection.

## How Worksection was introduced

As for the timeframe for adaptation, basically (setting tasks, deadlines
etc.), it lasts for one and a half months.

  

> I recommend not to try to integrate all functions at once, it is better to
> solve one problem which is urgent right now.

We tried to introduce time tracking three times. And only at the third time we
succeeded, when the HR service started to monitor the frequency of records.
For two weeks, our HR director was tracking and wisely reminding everybody to
enable the timer and enter the time consumed. As a result, the employees never
started to enable the timer, but instead they indicate hours by their tasks.
By this moment, everybody has got used to it, and now this process flows by
itself.

  

Now all our new employees get connected to the system and become involved in
work over a couple of days. **The employees are instructed on how to work in
Worksection by special guidelines.** Project managers get instructed by
separate guidelines.

  

> At first, you need someone to monitor the introduction process and remind
> you of the action.

  

### The way Worksection is used by different departments of the company

HRs supervise how the time is recorded by the employees by using the frequency
diagram of time. Some time ago, they reminded if someone forgot do to so. But
now nobody forgets.

Account managers actively use the Gantt diagram. They shift timeframes and
create related tasks. They also export project timelines to Excel for
customers.

  

![](/images/upload/vintage_gannt_x1.@x1_1.png)  

  

Finance and HR specialists view and analyze time reports by projects and
customers. By doing so, they obtain marginality of customers and projects, the
efficiency of departments and employees, and the team’s workload. The finance
department exports the reports to Excel and manipulates data from Excel.

  

![](/images/upload/Vintage_reports_time_people_nobyday_x1.@x1.png)  

  

The studio usually does not invite customers to the project tool, although
Worksection makes it possible. But an exception is made for longstanding
customers we cooperate with on a regular basis. They have access to their
project, they view the work progress on their tasks, and we have no necessity
to form regular reports for customers. The entire correspondence with
customers is constantly recorded in a written form. Even if a verbal
arrangement has been reached, it is duplicated in a comment to the task to
record the event of such arrangement.

  

## What are the current deficiencies in Worksection?

The product is simple, and sometimes it lacks some points which we “cover”
with other products, but it is not critical. Perhaps, for me personally, lack
of a financial controller functionality is the greatest deficiency.

  

## What is attractive in Worksection?

  1. **Simplicity which enables the entire team** (both technical and creative specialists) **to get instantly involved in work performed through this product.**
  2. Compact interface makes it possible to place much information on the screen. The framework is not overloaded as in 1C.
  3. In many products which I tested, the speed of work irritated me. **Worksection’s** operation is fast, which is a great upside. 

  

It is an optimal system offering enough functions, but it is not overloaded in
its interface.

##  Our gain from Worksection

This tool has already been embedded in the company’s culture. It represents
our established habit. We cannot imagine our life without this system, and I
think that if we do without it, our efficiency will drop down by 30% because
of chaos and uncertainty.
