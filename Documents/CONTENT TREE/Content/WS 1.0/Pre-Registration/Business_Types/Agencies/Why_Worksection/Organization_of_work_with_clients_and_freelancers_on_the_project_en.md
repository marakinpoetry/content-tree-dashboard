# Organization of work with clients 
and freelancers on the project

###### How to organize work with customers or freelancers is a challenge that
affects every size business. After all, the success of a project is determined
by the ability to manage communication not only within the team, but also with
all parties involved, which often includes freelancers and clients.

Successful management of it is a **combination of general organizational
principles and automated project management systems.** The skillful balance of
practical knowledge and use of necessary tools determines the high level of
project management in a company.

  

In this article, we are going to tell you how to effectively organize the work
with clients and freelancers, as well as the tools of
[Worksection](https://worksection.com/en/) that will help you to do it.

## General principles of organizing the workflow

To collaborate effectively, you need to follow **these principles:**

  

![](/images/upload/Orhanizatsija_roboty_z_klijentam..._2_eng.@x1_1.png)
​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

  1. **​Open communication:** Establish a communication schedule to coordinate work and stick to it. Be clear and concise in discussions to avoid misunderstandings.
  2. **Transparency of work processes:** Maintain clarity at all stages of the work. Everyone should have access to the information they need to do their jobs effectively.
  3. **Regular feedback:** Maintain a process for receiving regular feedback from all participants to drive organizational improvement and resolve issues quickly.
  4. **Documentation:** All documents related to the project should be recorded for easy reference and accountability.
  5. **Quality Control:** There should be regular checkpoints to verify the quality of work and ensure that the project meets established standards and expectations.
  6. **Use project management tools:** Implement project management services, such as Worksection, to easily manage and centralize project information.

## ​The importance of a clear definition of roles and responsibilities

​It is worth creating a separate **internal process for working with clients
and freelancers,** in addition to the general principles. Using automated
tools will ensure that the organization continues to operate at a high level
regardless of external circumstances.

Defining [the scope of the project](https://worksection.com/en/blog/project-
scope.html) is the first step in working with clients. This process **involves
a detailed discussion** of project goals, deliverables, timelines, and the
specific roles the client will play throughout the project lifecycle. This
approach will help manage expectations and create an environment where both
sides understand their contribution to the success of the project.

  

To maintain transparent communication and control, **you can invite the client
in the Worksection project.** To get started, you need to create a separate
team and **mark it as a client team.** Such team will have limited access to
view expenses and reports by default.

  

![](/images/upload/Orhanizatsija_roboty_z_klijentam..._3_eng.@x1.png)  

You can also restrict user profile information from clients in the **_" Edit
employee"_** section.

### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/1f469-200d-1f4bb.png) Organizing work with
freelancers

The primary step when engaging freelancers in a project should be to **clearly
define the scope of work.** This will help set realistic expectations and
align the work of freelancers with the overall project goals. At this point,
**it's crucial to outline:**

  * your expectations for the work to be done;
  * the area of responsibility, what specific tasks the freelancer will perform
  * general standards of work performance;
  * deadlines.

​This will not only ensure the stability of the quality of the work performed,
but also minimize the risk of expanding the scope of work.

  

When working with freelancers, we also recommend **creating a separate team
for them** for convenience and granting rights based on the terms of
employment.

### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/1f454.png) Permissions in Worksection

In Worksection, you can also c**ustomize access to the system** for individual
users. Roles in Worksection are divided into **administrative and user ones.**
Each of them has a certain level of access to the system.

  

![](/images/upload/Orhanizatsija_roboty_z_klijentam..._5_eng.@x1.png)  

We will take a look at the **user roles** that are most common when working
with clients and freelancers:

#### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/1f453.png) Reader

The meaning of the role is fully revealed by its name. **The Reader can** only
view general information about the project, but cannot leave comments or be a
task performer.

  

The Reader role can be used **to involve the client in the project** and to
communicate transparently about compliance. At the same time, the client
cannot interact directly with the project, which ensures the integrity of the
workflow.

  

[Important note!] The reader role is free, but has a quantitative limit. **For
example,** on the [business plan](https://worksection.com/ua/price.html) that
includes 50 users, you can add 100 readers to the project, which is twice as
many.

#### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/2615.png) Guest

**A guest is a role with limited access to the system.** This user has access
only to those tasks in which he is marked as a responsible or subscriber.

  

![](/images/upload/Orhanizatsija_roboty_z_klijentam..._6_eng.@x1_1.png)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

#### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/261d-fe0f.png) User

**The user is** the most common role in the system. They can create, comment,
and see all tasks within the project they have been invited to.

#### Additional features

Whatever the role of the participant, **you can hide tasks within the added
project.**

**

**![](/images/upload/Orhanizatsija_roboty_z_klijentam..._7_eng.@x1.png)  
**

**And comments:**

  

![](/images/upload/Orhanizatsija_roboty_z_klijentam..._7_eng_1.@x1.png)  

So, with Worksection, **you can flexibly manage the visibility of
information** within a project, which is very convenient when engaging clients
and freelancers.

* * *

**To summarize,** the main difference between a Reader, a User, and a Guest is
the ability to interact with the system and the level of visibility of project
information with participants. So, depending on the format of cooperation, you
can choose the level of access that suits you.

## Change and adjustment management

Change and adjustment management can be divided **into three main areas:**

**  
**![](/images/upload/Orhanizatsija_roboty_z_klijentam..._8_eng.@x1.png)

### ​​​​ Scope creep management

​Scope creep can ruin even well-planned projects. This leads to delayed
deadlines and budget expansion. To handle this, it's important **to create a
formal process** for managing changes and scope adjustments.

  

**This includes** setting up a change request process. When any changes or
additions to the original scope of work need to be documented for review and
approval before they are implemented.

#### Project plan adjustments

Modifications are an integral part of any project. Effective project
management should anticipate the need for adjustments and **build flexibility
into the project plan.** This involves regular meetings to review progress and
address issues that may affect the project. Maintaining a supportive
environment for discussing potential changes and their implications can help
in project adjustments.

### Documentation and transparency

Keeping a record of agreements, changes, and all interactions throughout the
project **helps to maintain clear control.** Such transparency reduces
conflicts of interest and increases trust between all stakeholders. To
maintain the proper level of transparency and documentation, it is worth using
project management systems. **Worksection has a built-in analytics and
reporting system** that allows for transparent communication about the
progress of the project.

###### Worksection's report by people

  

By clearly defining roles and responsibilities, and having solid tools for
managing changes and adjustments, project managers can create a**collaborative
and productive work environment.** This approach not only optimizes the
contributions of freelancers and clients, but also helps to successfully
complete the project.

## Establishing clear communication and accountability

In any project involving freelancers and clients, transparent communication
and effective reporting **are essential to building trust, accountability, and
positive working relationships.** Here are a few steps to achieve open
communication and respect:

  

![](/images/upload/Orhanizatsija_roboty_z_klijentam..._10_eng.@x1.png)

### ​Step 1: Build trust and accountability

#### ​[Regular updates]

​By keeping all sides informed about the project's progress, challenges, and
successes, you demonstrate your commitment to the project goals and encourage
other participants to share their own updates. **This can be done through**
scheduled meetings, progress reports, and real-time information dashboards.

#### [Transparent reporting]

Make sure that reporting is not only consistent, **but also clear.** Use tools
that allow you to share the same information with freelancers and clients at
the same time. This transparency helps to set clear expectations and reduces
the possibility of confusion.

#### [Access to information]

Give all stakeholders access to the necessary project documentation, prior
communications, and other important information. Doing this can be facilitated
**by a centralized platform** where documents are stored and quickly
accessible.

### Step 2: Creating a positive work environment

#### [Respect and expertise]

**Respect and act professional** in all interactions. Whether it's a formal
meeting or a regular update. The way you communicate sets the tone for the
entire project.

#### [Acknowledge achievements]

**Give credit for the efforts and achievements** of team members, including
freelancers, on a regular basis. This can be a powerful motivator and enhance
the sense of importance to the project.

#### [Consider cultural diversity]

**Keep cultural diversity in mind,** especially when working with a team that
may cover multiple locations. This can have an impact on the format of
communication and interpersonal interaction, which are important for balanced
teamwork.

### Step 3: Provide feedback and open dialogue

#### [Feedback process]

**Establish clear feedback processes** that allow freelancers and clients to
express their opinions on the progress of the project and the completion of
ongoing tasks. This can be organized as part of scheduled meetings or through
surveys and polls.

#### [Quick response]

Try to **respond quickly and constructively** to feedback and concerns. This
will demonstrate the value of feedback and reinforce open communication.

#### ​​[Encourage questions]

​​**Provide opportunities to ask questions.** This will help minimize
uncertainty during the execution of the work.

* * *

_By prioritizing transparent communication and regular reporting, you can
create a project atmosphere where everyone's role is valued. This fosters
trust and builds strong, positive relationships between all parties involved._

## Bottom line

**An important part of building clear communication and cooperation** between
the company is the transparency of the participants and centralized access to
all the necessary information.

  

[Worksection](https://worksection.com/en/blog/project-scope.html) is a great
solution for such purposes. Its functionality includes tools for building a
clear reporting system, a centralized storage of all documents, and setting up
the rights of the participants involved. This makes the system convenient for
organizing both internal workflows and those involving third parties. ​
