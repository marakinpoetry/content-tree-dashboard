bottlenecks and provide data-driven insights on resource allocation and
project timelines. Another emerging trend is the enhancement of file preview
capabilities. Today’s tools allow teams to preview large creative files
without needing to download them. This makes it easier to review and provide
feedback quickly.

  

Lastly, creative project management software has also integrated **advanced
analytics features.** Teams can now track project performance in real-time,
