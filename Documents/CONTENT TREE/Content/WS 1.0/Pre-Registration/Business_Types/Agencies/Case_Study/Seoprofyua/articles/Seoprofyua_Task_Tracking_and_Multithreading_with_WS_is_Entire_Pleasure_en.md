# Seoprofy.ua: 
Task Tracking and Multithreading
with WS is Entire Pleasure!

**[Seoprofy.ua](https://seoprofy.ua/) is an international company geared
towards high performance in search promotion, contextual advertising and
content marketing. The company is currently engaged in promotion of websites
to the Western market.**

  

Basically, as the number of people, projects and tasks was growing, it became
necessary to track everything. We were in search of various CRMs which would
help us to manage such projects, work more efficiently and monitor all
processes. We started using it, and we introduced it after testing. We have
been taking advantage of Worksection for almost 18 months.

  

> I am far from believing that we could abandon this CRM not that soon, but at
> any time in general.

  

We are fully satisfied with it. It facilitates task management, provides a lot
of tricks which are helpful and make our work more productive and fruitful.

  

Worksection guys always affix something new. It fundamentally distinguishes
them from amongst other similar projects.

  

For instance, if you have no computer at hand, you take your phone, view
tasks, mark them, get them done and swiftly solve any issues wherever you are.

I recommend Worksection to those facing a choice of a high-quality CRM.
Firstly, all visual stuff there is a fun, for instance, I find it convenient
to perceive visual data, and there are many things which make it possible to
set a task quickly or to check the progress in the existing tasks.
Additionally, I can track all other team members working on various projects.
