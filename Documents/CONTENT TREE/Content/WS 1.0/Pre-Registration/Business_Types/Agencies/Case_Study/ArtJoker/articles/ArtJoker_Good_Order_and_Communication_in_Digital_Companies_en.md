[ArtJoker](https://artjoker.ua/ru/) has been in the market since 2006. We are
involved in development and promotion of

e-commerce businesses. Our clients are companies such as **Mitsui Group**
,**PepsiCo** , namely such brands as Toshiba, Pepsi, as well as Freshline,
Prostor etc.

  

  

We cover all needs of the client, ranging from development and design to
upgrading and promotion.

  

  

## How did you start using Worksection?

Before Worksection, we used to **write tasks on papers**. In the morning, we
put leaflets with tasks for each employee, and in the evening we collected
them with reports filled in. It was a wild but at the same time romantic time.

  

As the number of projects was growing, the work was slowing down. Some reports
and replies would be lost. A communication abyss emerged in the teams. A great
number of relationships turned teamwork into chaos.

  

  

As the business was systematized, we adopted Worksection, and we have been
continuing to use it for more than 6 years already. The company’s efficiency
grew **3 times**.

  

Since then, all tasks within projects have been controlled through
Worksection. Each employee knows what he/she is to do, and what work has
already been done.

  

  

> This is our primary and sole tool for task tracking.
> [Worksection](https://worksection.com/ua/) forms our basis in which we plan
> development processes and handle marketing tasks.

  

  

## How is Worksection useful for you?

  * **We deal with clients**

Our objective is to help clients to promote and sell their products. It is
important, especially in the digital field, to be able to discern the client’s
wishes and to find a “common language” with him. It is necessary to optimize
work processes and relationships with customers to ensure efficiency and high
quality of the products we create.

  

Everything is simple in Workseсtion: a project is created in a couple of
clicks, and the client’s account is added to it. It enables the client to get
involved in the work process: to track the project progress, to set new tasks
and to receive reports.

  * **We track time**

The key specific feature of Worksection is integral time tracking. It is
important for us to realize the amount of time spent for a project. The timer
and reports help to receive detailed statistics, which is convenient in
computing the project marginality.

  * **We send reports**

We notify some of our clients on fulfilled works via Worksection. There is
nothing difficult: the employees record their work results while closing
tasks, and responsible persons complete project work reports. Clients see this
information inside Worksection.

  

For more complex report operations, we have integrated 1C. Reports are
uploaded from WS to 1C to be recalculated there.

###### Reports may be uploaded to an Excel table

  

## Pressing tasks. Are there many expired ones?

As the company was growing, there were **more and more expired tasks**. It is
obvious that most of them have just lost their relevance. Some tasks are not
pressing for priorities. And sometimes employees simply forget to close a
task.

  

Worksection enables tracking**deadlines** in a couple of clicks.

To reduce the number of expired tasks, we always use task priorities and
deadlines. Some tasks require prompt response and execution with no delay.

  

Additionally, we have made a simple feature — a script for the chat messenger.
We have integrated it with Worksection. Gradually, we accustomed the bot to
differentiate between tasks set and received. Now, every Friday morning,
it**reminds what should be checked** , as well as to close “pressing” tasks.

  

  

If we stopped using **Worksection** today, the company’s efficiency would
decline dramatically.

  

## We maintain good order

Wise arrangement of projects contributes to the team’s efficiency. **To
minimize errors in communication** , we need a tool to enable all participants
to track, update and share statuses and reports in real time. Digital studios
handle huge volumes of digital data. The common space to manage all project
information will make it possible to store and safely transfer data to
employees and clients.
