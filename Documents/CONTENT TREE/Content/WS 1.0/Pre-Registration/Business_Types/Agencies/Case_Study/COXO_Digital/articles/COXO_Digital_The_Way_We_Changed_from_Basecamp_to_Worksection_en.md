# COXO Digital: 
The Way We Changed from 
Basecamp to Worksection

**In the course of development, companies need to revise tools they use to
solve business tasks.****A system for management of digital projects is one of
such essential tools. Alexander Kaydannik, CEO of the COXO Digital Agency ,
will tell us about the reasons why his company has transferred from Basecamp
to Worksection and about the advantages of the service which are most
significant for managing projects in a digital agency.**

  

One of the first projects of COXO was managing the Internet reputation and web
production for the Yakitoria chain of restaurants. Alexander recollects that
at the first stage of COXO’s life, its tasks were not very complex, thus
Basecamp was used to manage projects. As the agency was growing, projects
going far beyond the digital framework started to emerge. It became even more
difficult to arrange and control them.

  

### How Worksection was selected to manage digital projects?

Alexander explains: the system underlying COXO Digital’s work was reached not
at once: “Over the period of the agency’s activity, we have tried many systems
for project management in digital production. For a long time, we did not
manage to find a product which we would deem to be ours, thus we continued to
experiment. I cannot even remember the way we got to know about Worksection.
Naturally, we decided to try this system. At that time, WS covered all our
needs, such as analysis, time tracking and timing”.

> ultimately convenient for us in particular. It is cool when the developer of
> some major and popular software contacts a small local agency to directly
> ask for suggestions how to further improve the product.

Alexander confesses that Worksection is the most convenient system to manage
projects for development of websites, web applicatios and many other things.
Due to using the actual user experience, Worksection has provided a number of
helpful functions which facilitate COXO Digital’s dealing with such market
leaders as Nestle, Mary Kay, Vodafone, L’Oreal and Pepsi.

Worksection is currently the most convenient project management system for us.
I definitely recommend it to digital agencies, production studios and to other
companies needing to coordinate actions of numerous project groups, including
those involving outsource services.
