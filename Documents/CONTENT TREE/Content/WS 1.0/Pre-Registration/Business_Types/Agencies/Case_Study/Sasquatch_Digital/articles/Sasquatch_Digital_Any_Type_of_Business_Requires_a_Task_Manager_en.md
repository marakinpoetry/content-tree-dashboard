## Challenges from major brands

We have been operating in the market since 2009, dealing with online
communications. Our agency experience started from local projects for big
businesses, then we developed all-inclusive service for small businesses. And
eventually, we started to work with major brands.

  

Major brands mean complex companies with multilevel tasks which cannot be
planned on a sheet of paper or in an Excel table. A website, BTL activation,
dealing with opinion leaders, content creation, its distribution and promotion
– it is impossible to retain such scope of tasks in mind, no matter how
multitasked and efficient manager you are.

  

###### The senior manager should oversee the team’s activities, know what
happens and when, who does what, and he/she has to understand how much time is
needed for it.

  

## Why Worksection

**How to make an advertising agency up and running?**

At a certain point, we came to a conclusion that we needed a task manager. We
tried using Basecamp, Asana, Trello and other systems. We enquired what was
popular in the market, what our colleagues and customers used.

  

As a result, we ended up operating Worksection. For us, this system appeared
to be the most user-friendly one, we even did not have to view the video
guidelines. The team adopted Worksection with no hassle.

  

###### _Being part of Sasquatch Digital, we are keen on the system approach to
have everything wellorganized._

When I open the program, I see lists, tables, kanban, and it brings me into
the condition of operational serenity. I understand that everything is under
control.

  

## One program for everybody

Our team consists of 15 persons: designers, RND department, SMM specialists,
account managers and the team in charge of comprehensive advertising. All
specialists have different tasks. For some of them, it is essential to track
the timing. For instance, our account clearly ranks tasks in order of urgency.
As for me, I need to see priorities in tasks. I look at the colored scale, and
everything becomes clear for me.

The whole team actively communicates in Worksection.

It is excellent to have a system describing the whole work of a team. It makes
it possible to get back to any point and clarify details.

  

## What I like in it

I like the fact about Worksection that we can transform the scope of tasks for
ourselves. For instance, we may highlight something with a color, format a
text to draw attention to some point, add links, upload files. And finally, we
may integrate all these with Slack or Google Doc, which is very useful for an
event agency.

  

What is convenient is the kanban function. Of course we might cover all walls
with sticky notes in our office, but what for? In Worksection, I have the
kanban view fully configured. It is a compact and convenient software to
perceive all ongoing tasks and processes.

## About emojis

We use an entire set of emojis available in Worksection. We even used to ask
our employees: “Just send “thumb-up” if you accept the task!” It is
convenient.

Recently we were discussing what could be added to the emojis. And we
understood that Worksection has few negative smileys. Will you please add
some?

  

## Life before Worksection

Before adopting Worksection, we just discussed tasks between ourselves and set
them via email. We lacked a structured task-setting process. Something could
be lost, something could be overlooked or misperceived by a team member. We
did not have clear understanding who would do what today. One always had to
raise his/her head and ask: “What are you doing today?”

  

## About planning

**In what way are hourly rates counted in a digital agency?**

**  
**

Any type of business requires a task manager. Everywhere, if there are more
than two executors, planning is crucial, as well as control of tasks and
processes. Let us assume that we underuse the function of work hours rating in
Worksection.

  

At the same time, there are companies for which time tracking is the number
one issue. There is an entire stratum of freelancers who want to work in a
systematic and regulated way. By using Worksection, whey may get connected
into an agency project and interact with customers there.

  

###### _Worksection is a logical and convenient solution for digital entities.
It is much better than a  
notebook._

If we take Worksection away from the agency’s processes, every second person
will say: “How shall I set a task now?”, the rest will exclaim: “I had all my
plans there!” Worksection structures not only the team’s work, but the
person’s own daily schedule. It is really convenient.
