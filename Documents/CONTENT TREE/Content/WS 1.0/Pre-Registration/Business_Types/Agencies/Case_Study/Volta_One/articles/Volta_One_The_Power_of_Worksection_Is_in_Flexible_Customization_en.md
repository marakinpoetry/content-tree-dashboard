# Volta One: The Power of 
Worksection Is in Flexible 
Customization

## About [Volta One](https://volta.one/):

  * **Digital** agency;
  * **30 persons** in the team;
  * **3 years** in the market;
  * **Worksection has been** used since the company’s outset.
  * **Clients:** Uber, L’Oreal, Garnier, AB InBev, KFC etc.

  

  

  

### Why Worksection

Volta **[One has](https://volta.one/)** been operating for 3 years already. We
provide services in Digital Production and social media marketing. We mainly
cooperate with corporate clients — **Uber, AB InBev, L’Oreal** and their
brands, such as **Bud, Staropramen, Maybelline New York etc.** We also handle
startups spreading their products to the international market.

  

> The problem of most task managers is that they are tailored for IT
> companies, being badly adjusted for the day-to-day realities of a digital
> agency.

  

The issue of arranging the work process arose from the very first day of the
company’s existence. We tried Trello, Asana and other task managers. The
problem of such systems is that they are badly adjusted for the day-to-day
realities of a digital agency. Most of them are tailored for IT сompanies with
specific internal processes.

  

Worksection’s benefit is the possibility to configure the work for your needs.

  

### How we launched it

Of course, we were assisted in adopting Worksection: we got advice,
explanations and training. It is essential that the product developers consult
their clients, hear them and help to find answers to questions which may arise
in work. Such personal support is very important.

  

Now Worksection is the basic tool of the company’s operational activities. In
Worksection, we set tasks, plan projects, calculate the time consumed. Each
team member asking “what am I to do today?” finds an answer in Worksection.

  

Without this system, the company would continue to work, but it would require
much more resources for day-to-day management. We would need to employ people
to compensate for the function currently fulfilled by Worksection, or hang
boards outwritten with tasks round the office.

  

  

> Now [Worksection](https://worksection.com/) is the main tool in the
> company’s operational activities

  

  

### What we use

We **use almost all functionality of Worksection** , except for storing files.
The project managers use the Gantt chart . It enables them to plan the
company’s resources flexibly, to understand the way projects link up, to make
sure they do not overlap.

###### Gantt chart in Worksection

We had experiments of connecting clients to Worksection, but it did not take
roots. In our case, the account manager conveys to the client what is needed.

  

The main reports used by us cover the time consumed and its distribution by
projects. Thus, we

evaluate the performance of the whole company and of each employee.

###### Reports in Worksection

### The way we use it

At first, we used Worksection in the way it had been conceived by the
developers, pursuant to its authors’ advice. Not everything ran smoothly. It
was difficult to manage such large range of tasks, and we could handle 20-30
projects simultaneously. We needed to control them continuously at all levels
– top management, middle management and executors.

  

When Worksection kanban was introduced, these problems got solved. We could
fully represent the company’s management structure, as well as the structure
of handling projects. “Kanban” enabled each group to obtain what was needed.

  

> At a certain moment, we realized that the power of this tool is
> **customization** , and we decided to modify Worksection to fit our needs.

  

### Custom version

Our first and non-obvious solution was to opt out of handling projects in the
“Projects” section.**Our typical project** takes the form of a task with
subtasks.

  

We divide our projects into external and internal ones. **The basic view**
used by us is **“kanban”**

with a pre-built workflow, statuses and labels guiding the project. Each board
represents a

department consisting of designers, copywriters, developers and marketing
managers. There are

also boards related to the project status, such as “documents” and “general
register of projects”.

Each our project starts out in the Upcoming section. We plan it and realize
the way it is to take off, the way to handle it. Then the project gets into
the board of the respective department. The project manager is responsible for
everything going on within the project. He views all tasks, their sequence and
coherence, as well as deadlines and priorities for end users. The end
executors, in turn, see their load and priorities of tasks by simply clicking
on their photos. The top management can also monitor all projects.

  

What is convenient in such system? Each employee of the company understands
what he/she is to do now and anytime soon. The executor can obtain tasks from
different project managers, and he also coordinates priorities in task
execution with the PMs. At our weekly meetings, we set global priorities.

  

  

### Statuses and labels

We developed statuses for the processes which really take place in our
company. For instance, the video production department has its own work
processes and labels. They may customize the workflow “for themselves”, to fit
it into their reality. This is a unique inherent feature of Worksection which
we have not seen in other systems.

###### Labels in Worksection

  1. Labels are an important aspect of Worksection’s functional possibilities. They help to identify the project type.
  2. You may also use labels to indicate the task status.

  

Worksection will fit all types of businesses where  
**people are the main resource**

  

###  

### Tailored for Digital

**Our work model** in Worksection might be used in any digital agency which
handles a lot of projects. If several dozens of projects – internal, external,
suspended or perhaps pending — it is very difficult to manage them. It is even
impossible to evaluate what is going on.

  

We can handle about **20 projects** simultaneously. Due to Worksection, four
project managers cope with such scope. Worksection will fit all types of
businesses where **people** are the main resource. These are production
companies, digital agencies, architectural bureaus perhaps.

  

> To manage projects and people efficiently, a proper tool is needed.
> Worksection is just such sort of a tool.
