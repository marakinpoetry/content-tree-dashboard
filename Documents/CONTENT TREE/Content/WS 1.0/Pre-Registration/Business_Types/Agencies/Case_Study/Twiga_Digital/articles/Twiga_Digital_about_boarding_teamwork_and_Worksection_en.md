# Twiga Digital: about boarding,
teamwork and Worksection

## Summary

Two years ago the agency had Post Office, Telegrams and legs for
communication. A lot of information was lost and it was a spoiled phone. Now
there is a Worksection and everything is stored in one place.

Natalya Sokolik represents a position in Twiga Digital. The company is part of
the TwigaUkraine communication group — TOP-3 by efficiency among all
communication groups in Ukraine. Twiga Ukraine includes 6 agencies providing
product and sales promotion: Lions, Media First, Twiga Go, Twiga Digital, Lovi
Video, MedInform.

  

  

## What is the activity of Twiga Ukraine

**Twiga Ukraine** is a single organism comprising 6 agencies. The expertise of
our agencies is enough to cover all needs of a client. Twiga Digital is one of
the agencies.

  

#### **The company fosters the values from the giraffe.**

_(“twiga” means “giraffe” as translated from Swahili)_

  

From amongst all the world’s animals, the giraffe has the biggest heart. It
can run for a long time without drinking and eating. We joke that our team
resembles a giraffe: we are capable of working 24/7 and need nothing more.

Twiga Ukraine usually deals with clients on a long-term basis, for 12-14
years. We believe that only in long-term cooperation, lasting for 2-3 years or
more, we can track the efficiency of a certain strategy.

We have both internal and external clients. The external ones are Pepsi,
Roshen, ProCredit Bank, Henkel, Royal Canin, etc. These are direct clients,
and everything is simple and clear with them. And also, there are internal
clients.

  

For instance, our Twiga Gо agency has won a big tender for realizing a
creative idea and strategy of a festival for the PUMB Bank.

  

_The rest of TwigaUkraine agencies are also entrusted with tasks for the work
upon this project._

## How was the work structured in Twiga Digital?

Two years ago, when I came to work in Twiga Digital, the agency had mail,
Telegram and legs for communication (editorial: laughing). It was very
difficult. Do you need to ask something? You go to another wing, for example,
to coordinate a task with a designer. Having discussed the idea, we recorded
everything in the mailbox.

  

The main thing is when you have 45 persons, and everyone is in the same
project, where the trickiest things begin, such as someone’s failing to find
out about the task on time, forgetting to notify another one from another
wing, someone’s missing a message in mail etc. So much information was lost,
and it was like grape vine. Now we have briefs, and everything is stored in a
single place.

  

Before Twiga Digital, I had operated Worksection for 5 years at my previous
job, which was followed by 6 months of work without it.

  

> When you fall into the same trap, you think: 'Had we been operating
> Worksection from the outset, nothing would have been lost…’. A month later,
> I said: ‘Guys, we need a task manager’.

  

  

## Why is Worksection our choice?

    
    
    Native and very easy to explain to people how to work in a luck manager

Alongside with Worksection, I had an experience of dealing with clients in
Trello, Bitrix24, and Asana. But Worksection suited us in the best way.
Everything is clear, native, and it is very simple to explain to people how to
use the task manager.

  

Worksection does not require creating 45 subtasks for every person. In a
single task, you can specify subtasks, tag those concerned, and mark with a
bell the project manager who is to view the task. The functionality is
circumspect.

  

  

## Was onboarding quick?

    
    
    No :(            But, it was very smooth and comfortable.

At first, we used Worksection only in the digital agency. As compared with
Asana, I already knew that Worksection makes it easier to select a responsible
executive, to set a task, to exclude employees from a team, for instance, if
they are distracted by notifications from a task they are not involved in.

  

#### _There are many functions which differ from other task managers._

As time passed by, our creative people (Lions is also one of the six Twiga
Ukraine agencies) also realized that Worksection means convenience. We held an
introductory training, and one of the six agencies agreed to have a trial of
the task manager.

  

**Our Media First agency was the first one to get involved. It was followed by
two more agencies.**

**  
**

### As of now, five out of six agencies are Worksection-geared.

We held several Worksection training sessions for our employees, made basic
settings, and we are planning to connect our clients to the task manager by
giving them access to projects, since it is important for them.

  

For example, project designers will track the time spent on the project, and
the client will be able to see that information for making an hourly
calculation, pursuant to a contract.

Worksection clearly displays the following for our clients: the time of
setting the task, the time interval allocated for it, time session count and
tracking for each individual employee. The client receives reports on a daily
basis.

  

  

## **How do you make reports in Worksection?**

    
    
    We make reports by projects and by clients. 

  

It is very convenient. Internally, our agencies have a documentary report and
task report, so as not to forget ‘who owes what to whom’.

One of our clients asked: ‘Can I buy a tool to record reports?’ We said that
nothing was to be bought. Worksection was already in place. In Worksection, we
created an account for the client, added 8 employees on the client’s side and
created a single profile for them.

> For clients, we transfer reports to clients’ Excel tables and send them out.
> There is a template for it.

  

## What types of Worksection-based projects do you use?

We break down Worksection internally into the agencies handling their own
projects.

  

And we have a common project – “New Business”. It unites all employees. If a
new project appears, we create a team for it. We send notifications to those
who are to be involved in the project.

  

**This is the hierarchy of the most important part of Worksection - work with
tasks:**

  

![](/images/upload/TWIGA_ierarhy.@x1_4.png)  

We set labels in projects. It may be done if a client has set a task on hold
due to quarantine, or if a budget is reduced with discussions postponed to the
next year.

  

It is very convenient then to view the total number of projects we have done,
the number of tasks closed, to measure the benefit and lost, to assess the
amount of work held up.

> Worksection is a great aid in remote work. Communication is abundant, and it
> now takes 24/7. Designers, creative team members, copywriters and
> influencers are working remotely now. They may visit the office once per
> month if they need to speak with a client.

Worksection houses all our client-related and internal issues. The system
folders contain everything concerning administrative affairs. All of them are
included in subtasks. All necessary accesses for employes are there.

  

  

### Do you remunerate your employees on an hourly basis?

    
    
    No, we don’t. 

Unfortunately, the employees’ attitude to time tracking is still negative. Of
course, we explain that, by using tracking, you help both yourselves and us.
It is important to know the amount of time required to fulfill the task both
for the client and for us. Our employees perceive tracking as something that
restricts their liberty.

What is more, we perform a lot of creative work, and creativity cannot be
measured in hours. But we have deadlines in which we need to release a certain
creative product. Thus, we cannot count it on an hourly basis.

  

## What is the main value of Worksection as compared with other task managers?

It is absolutely native and comprehensible. For example, it is often said that
IOS is clear even for a child. The same is about Worksection: everything is
visible, no search needed, no instructions are to be read before using it.
There is nothing hidden, all functions are visible at once.

You spend 5 minutes to set a task, notify people, and they come at once to
fulfill the task. Here you can also see the number of people having viewed the
task. It is like an open chat.

  

  

## Does your company have any internal rules for Worksection?

Yes, it does. One of the rules is that those having accepted the work should
write back. There is one more rule: setting a task does not necessarily mean
its acceptance. Thus, it is better to send a link to a task in any messenger.

  

Task closure and project cleansing are our weak points. It is significant to
check deadlines for the task completed. If deadlines have been disrupted
because of a particular person, the reason should be clarified.

  

![](/images/upload/TWIGA_Task_body_and_convertation.@x1_1.png)  

‘No task in Worksection means no task being set’, - this is our rule.

_One more [important rule] is: you close a project in Worksection and then
analyse the work done._

_ _

_Having spent time on task setting, you understand what you lack for the team
to complete this task._

  

  

## What else do you like in using Worksection

This task manager teaches you to work correctly. Correctly is when everything
is clear in the task, with no questions from employees remaining. They clearly
understand what should be done.

  

If employees have many questions while completing the task, it means that the
project is formalized badly, and you have learnt little information from the
client.

**Worksection for me is a litmus test. Do we work well or badly? Before
Worksection, we lacked a litmus test. Things are lost in mail, and
correspondence after 6 pm is horrible.**

For example, we have had an awkward situation with a project. I log in
Worksection and read comments under a project. It makes me spot the
bottleneck. I can view the structure at once: the starting point, the time
when the client sent corrections, the time they were done, who and what caused
the delay.

  

I am always well-prepared for a meeting with a client. It is essential,
especially if you are a company’s senior executive.

  

**If you want to be efficient, if you strive for doing high-quality work by
keeping to deadlines – you need Worksection.**

Feedback also works quickly. Wherever you log in, you can see the support icon
with no need to search for anything. You receive a response in 20 minutes at
the latest.
