# Genius Marketing: 
Worksection is convenient, with
company works better

#### You occupied the Product Owner position in two companies: OSD Group and
later GeniusMarketing. How many employees worked for the companies and what is
the specific nature of GeniusMarketing’s operation?

  

OSD Group employs about one hundred persons. GeniusMarketing – about 80.
GeniusMarketing is an education project teaching digital marketing for
business owners and specialists in various fields. It also fosters development
in this area.

  

  

## Who is the Product Owner? What is the nature of this job?

It depends on a company. In GeniusMarketing, the Product Owner manages the
line of products linked by one criterion. I was the Product Owner dealing with
entrepreneurs.

  

Our products were for entrepreneurs. Our training was about leveling up a
business, about advancing in it by using internet marketing.

  

#### I was in charge of creating excellent products certain to be sold well.

  

> It means that you worked on brand-new projects which had never existed, with
> ways to sell them totally unclear? Were those absolutely new projects?

  

It depended. There were projects previously run, but there were also new ones,
which we created without knowing whether or not they would take off.

  

  

## Who worked on projects with you?

Our IT team worked on creating or adjusting the platform. When preparing a
launch of a marketing project, we also involved a designer, copywriter and
marketer. Thus, projects were handled by mixed teams.

  

  

### How did you learn about Worksection task manager?

I got to know Worksection long ago. Before the GeniusMarketing company, I
worked at OSD Group, a major marketing holding. There I had a team of managers
and **more than ten projects** which I handled **simultaneously**. All eleven
departments were interconnected. Every department consisted of subdivisions.
The subdivisions had numerous employees.

  

#### In general, we needed a system which could help us run projects in their
entirety. It was 5-6 years ago. We could not lose or forget anything. We had
to track deadlines. We needed to store projects constantly growing in number.

  

###### At first, we introduced Worksection in our department. It appealed to
us. We scaled it up to other companies. For 18 months was I working as a
Worksection-powered manager for OSD Group. In GeniusMarketing, we also came to
a decision that we needed to introduce a project management system.

  

> Worksection was the first thing that came across my mind. I recommended it.
> The owners considered, then tested and introduced it.

  

## Does the entire team work based on Worksection?

The whole company switched to Worksection long ago. We have even **connected
our contractors in the task manager.** There are teams and there are projects.
In each project, I invited people needed to work on the project.

We have developed our internal guidelines to operate the system. Everything
should be in Worksection. When it comes to an external contractor, the time of
expenditure is to be tracked. If a task was not set in Worksection, it meant
its low priority. Everything is recorded in the task manager for us to
understand the extent**to which the teams are loaded**.

## Which Worksection functions do you use?

In spring, the GeniusMarketing company switched to unit economy. The internal
workflow system was fully transformed. The designers, copywriters and YOUtube
managers got performance-based remuneration (project-based) instead of rated
salaries. We started to prefer outsourcing and to use time tracking.

I have a rhetorical question: how is it possible to work without using such
product as Worksection? It is very convenient indeed.

**This year has shown everyone that if you are not online, it means that you
and your business don’t exist basically.**

  

_We also use time consumption reports to figure out exactly how much time and
money we have spent to implement a project._

  

  

## What is inconvenient in Worksection?

Personally, I have no questions concerning UX. The three-minute instruction
video is enough to understand how to use Worksection. You set a task, then a
subtask, then you work.

### What is the main reason to opt for Worksection?

Worksection offers the entire functionality necessary for a mixed team. You
set a task, upload data into the Gantt chart. You make adjustments, and
everything gets changed automatically. Before Worksection, we built Gantt
charts in Excel with coloring them.

  

#### If you are a Project manager and want all projects to be under your
control, make sure to use the project management system. I strongly recommend
Worksection. You can always digitize all indicators there. It is very
convenient.
