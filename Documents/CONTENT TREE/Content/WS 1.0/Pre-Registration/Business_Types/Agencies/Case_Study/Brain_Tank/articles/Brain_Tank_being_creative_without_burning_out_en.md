# Brain Tank: being creative
without burning out

The Worksection team visited the office of [**Brain
Tank**](https://braintank.ua/about-brain-tank/), a creative marketing
communications agency. Together with **Yevhenii Myroniuk** , managing partner
for strategy, we discussed the importance of creativity and the minimum budget
for launching a brand, talked about the features of remote work for creative
agencies and how to stand out among competitors.

  

**Short reference:**

**Brain Tank** is a full-cycle creative marketing communications agency,
founded in 2004 by Yevhenii Myroniuk and Andrii Franchuk, which started as an
inhouse-PR media holding, going through the Royal® Advertising advertising
agency, directly to a group of companies united in 2019 into a high
performance promo "machine" \- Brain Tank.

## What is Brain Tank and what is the role of the manager for strategy in the
agency?

**Brain Tank** is a marketing agency. In our work, we do almost everything
that precedes media placement, namely: creative, planning of mechanics and
activation. In short, we analyze how business processes are arranged and try
to implement an **advertising product** accordingly.

## What makes Brain Tank stand out from the competition?

Our main feature is **hyper-adaptability.** This means that we know how to
work and solve tasks under conditions of limitations, because they are not a
destabilizing factor for us. Secondly, we have a complete "offshore of
information". That is, all our teams have access to all past achievements
accumulated during work. This helps us strengthen our expertise based on
previous experience.

###### Examples of Brain Tank marketing agency projects

## What helps you to cooperate with international companies?

**Chingiz Barinov** , one of the founders of Worksection, said that  _" the
project management system must be implemented where there is already a project
management procedure."_ We have both a procedure and a system that ensured the
structured and efficient teamwork. We have been working in the
[**Worksection**](https://worksection.com/en/) project management service
since 2013. Before that, we tried everything from Megaplan to Jira, but it was
all wrong.

The advantage of Worksection is that it manages to "keep up" with our
expectations: where we need to scale, **Worksection offers a solution** that
allows us to do so.

## Creativity or budget — which is more important for brand launch?

The aim of the budget is to show the importance of a certain product to the
audience. If we have a great product with amazing features, but we don't have
a way to talk about it, nothing happens. If we talk about a product that does
nothing and affects nothing, nothing will happen either. These are all
parallel entities that need to be taken into account, because **nothing will
work without a budget as well as without a good idea.**

  

###### "A task that is highly fragmented into parts is unmanageable,  
and excessively generalized - unimplementable"

## Does remote work affect team productivity?

No, because none of us works remotely. I firmly believe that any inspiration
required for making a creative product here and now cannot appear at a
distance. Working in the office makes us top fit, nothing separates us, and
there is no mental mixing of everyday life and work. Here we work, **we create
a product together,** but as soon as the office door closes, we have a rest.

## What helps motivate the team?

We are motivated by solving problems for which we do not yet know the
solution. Of course, we solve a lot of routine tasks that are part of
business. However, we are inspired by the possibility of solving such complex
tasks.

## What do you do when you miss deadlines?

The first thing we do is fix the error, immediately try to find the causes,
minimize the consequences and notify all partners about it. After that, we
make workshops where we discuss possible solutions. **We never hide
mistakes,** even if they are unpleasant for everyone involved. Our teams
always adhere to the principle of openness.

## How do you keep motivated and maintain the desire to work?

**The open-and-closed door tactic** helps me a lot: I create a product in the
office, but I don't do it in other places. And that's what allows me to switch
on and off when I need to. Like muscles: tension and relaxation.
