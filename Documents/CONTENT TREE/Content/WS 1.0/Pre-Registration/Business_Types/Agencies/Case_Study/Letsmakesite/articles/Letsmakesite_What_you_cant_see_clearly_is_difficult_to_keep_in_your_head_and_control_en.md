# Letsmake.site: «What you can't see 
clearly is difficult to keep in your head 
and control»

**Mykyta Lovikov,** CEO and founder of the
[**Letsmake.site**](https://letsmake.site/) web studio, shared his experience
of using Worksection with us. Besides, Mykyta spoke about interesting insights
about success and failure of projects, as well as how prioritization can
replace task deadlines.

## Tell us about your company

We are the **Letsmake.site** web studio, we develop turnkey websites. Our
clients are small and medium-sized businesses that seek to effectively present
themselves online, increase the number of clients or expand their business
through entering new markets and attracting search traffic.

## Let's talk about the features of your projects

The result of our projects is usually the **creation of a new site** or
updating the functionality of existing ones. Depending on the format and
scale, it takes from 2 to 12 weeks. The development of a full-fledged turnkey
corporate website takes on average 6-8 weeks.

  

Usually, **3-4 people** participate in each project, but for large projects,
we involve additional narrow specialists for non-core work. In addition, as
the owner of the studio, I am personally involved in the key stages of each
project.

## Why do you think unsuccessful projects happen?

Unsuccessful projects occur when a failure occurs during the work on the
project. Moreover, most problems in development projects, in my experience,
occur because of **failures in the work and communication** of the managing
staff.

  

If you lose focus at the current moment, you can very quickly fail any
project.

If we talk about the success of projects, for me it means positive feedback
from the client, the team's satisfaction with the work result and compliance
with the planned profit indicators. And the **indicator of this success** is
the traffic, sales and business growth of my clients, which guarantees my
professional growth. And therefore, my profit. That's why I'm interested in
the sites we make being effective, not just pretty.

## How did you know it was time to implement a project management system?

I have been using **Worksection** for a long time, since appr. 2015. I tried
it first for personal tasks, then suggested and implemented it in the company
where I worked as a marketer at that time. This was preceded by a stage of
**chaos, notebooks, Google Sheets and Trello.** The number of projects
increased, switching between boards became more and more difficult.

  

Therefore, there was a need to organize **control of all projects in one
place.** That's how I found Worksection. And when I started my own business, I
had no doubts about which task manager I needed to organize processes.

## How does Worksection help you at work?

Worksection helped me build a **clear business process.**

  

All tasks must exist in the **task manager.** Because what you cannot see
clearly is difficult to keep in your head and control.

Also, all updates, results of discussions and agreements should be recorded in
comments to the specific task to which they relate. There is a **list of
stages** that each task goes through (WAIT, DO, CONTROL, DONE). And there is a
responsible person for each stage.

  

Worksection highlights overdue tasks in red. And when I systematically had the
entire service interface glowing red from such tasks week after week, I
thought:

  

**_Can I control the future?_** \- No.

**_Am I able to predict the creative process of other people?_** \- No.

  

All I can do as a manager is to determine what is important to do at the
moment and communicate that to the final executor.

  

That's when I started using **task prioritization** instead of deadlines.

The Worksection interface stopped flashing red, the tension in the team's work
disappeared, and the number of successful tasks and projects began to grow
rapidly.

## What is the key to a successful project?

High-quality planning and work with risks, as well as well-organized project
communication between all its participants.

  

For me, the **main criterion of a successful project** is the total
satisfaction of all parties: the customer, the team and myself as the owner of
the studio. And this includes meeting the deadlines/​quality/​cost of the
project for the customer, and the interest of the project for the professional
growth of the team, and the planned profitability indicators for me.

Because when someone remains unsatisfied, **you cannot call the project
successful.**

##  Which companies do you think Worksection would be suitable for?

I know from my own experience that Worksection will definitely suit any
**small and medium-sized company with up to 20-30 people.** Although it will
also be useful for other industries and large companies, because the system
offers a flexible opportunity for any process organization: from sales and
marketing to recruiting and onboarding of employees.

  

I can definitely recommend Worksection as a task and process management system
for business, because it has everything you need to organize the company's
work. It is **useful and not annoying,** and this is very important :)​​​​​​
