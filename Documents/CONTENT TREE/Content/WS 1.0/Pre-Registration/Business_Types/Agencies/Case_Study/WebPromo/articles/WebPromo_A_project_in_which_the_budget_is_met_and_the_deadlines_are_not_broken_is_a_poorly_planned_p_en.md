# WebPromo: “A project in which the 
budget is met and the deadlines are 
not broken is a poorly planned 
project”

The Worksection team met with Co-owner Aсademy
[WebPromoExperts](https://webpromoexperts.net/courses/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=webpromoexperts.net_brand_search_brand-
keywords_conversions&utm_term=webpromoexperts&gclid=CjwKCAiAu5agBhBzEiwAdiR5tMaAobqrppY9yeGkzTwFf9m7gOMHpjOH_6xd0E7TZQ4w8M6QzcrfihoCezEQAvD_BwE)
and the CEO of [SkillsBooster Digital Marketing
Academy](https://www.skillsbooster.net/) **Anton Voroniuk** , and discussed
the company's work, their ways to manage multiple projects, motivate oneself
and the team, without burning out.

  

**Reference:**

**WebPromoGroup** is a group of companies consisting of _Webpromo_ , an
Effective Internet Marketing Agency, _WebPromoExperts_ , an Academy of
Internet Marketing #1 in Ukraine,  _Devo_ , which creates and promotes
projects in foreign markets, and _SkillsBooster_ is an international digital
marketing academy with over 440K students from 198 countries on
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/woronyuk/).

  

Since 2008, the agency has implemented more than 1,500 successful projects.
Webpromo is also an official partner of Google with Premier status since 2016,
Meta Business Partners since 2020 and a member of the IAB Ukraine association.

## What is WebPromoGroup and what does the company do?

We have been doing Internet marketing for 12 years, helping businesses
increase their online sales or become experts in the field. Our company works
with such well-known brands as **Vodafone, Auchan, Metro, Nova Poshta** , etc.
The Academy has already trained 10,000 graduates in many fields: internet
marketing, SMM, SEO, PPC specialist, WEB analytics, etc.

## What is the secret of your team's self-organization?

Company’s mission is the main vector of business growth for us. Especially in
the educational business - these are not empty words, because you really
change people's lives and it is very exciting. We are inspired by the story of
our student who knew nothing about Internet marketing before his studies, and
now he is a marketing director in a cool company. The idea that **we are
helping people** inspires the team and makes us organize.

## What digital tools help in remote work?

Online services are very helpful, especially in remote work, namely
[**Worksection**](https://worksection.com/), Google Suite, Google Meet. We
have been working with Worksection for over 8 years, since we got
recommendations about this service. In our daily work, we use almost all of
its classic features: project creation, role distribution, project control,
Gantt chart, etc. Also, depending on the project, we use a **built-in timer.**

## What is the main metric of project success for you?

A project in which the budget is met and the deadlines are not broken is a
poorly planned project ![](/images/upload/avatar_alex.@x1_21.png)  
  

Of course, the KPI of the project is always a **strict compliance with the
deadlines and budget.** But taking into account the fact that projects in
marketing are always long-term projects, I would also add client orientation,
that is, maintaining good relations with the client.

## Burnout: how do you eliminate it and where do you find motivation?

The question of burnout is always about **understanding values.** And again it
is worth mentioning the importance of the mission: we help people change,
build a career, earn more. We constantly receive feedback from clients and
students, thanks to which burnout is reduced to nothing.

  

The second point is **internal motivation,** which is based on the fact that I
get high from what I do. My wife, children, academy, agency, and everything
surrounding me is my little microcosm that I love.

## How do you save energy for active work?

The law of conservation of energy applies here: the more you give, the more
you get. But in work, as well as in sports, you should not have 7 days of
active work. After you have worked hard, you should get some rest.
