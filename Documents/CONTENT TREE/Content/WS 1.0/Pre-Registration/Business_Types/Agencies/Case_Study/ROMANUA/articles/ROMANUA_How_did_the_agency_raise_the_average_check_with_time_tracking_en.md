# ROMAN.UA:
How did the agency raise the
average check with time tracking?

Roman Rybalchenko is a founder of Roman UA, a performance marketing agency.
The agency assists B2B, IT and E-commerce companies in building marketing on
Internet.

  

### At what time did you understand that you needed a project planner?

We have been operating Worksection**from the first day.** We spied it from
another advertising agency. I liked the fact that this time manager enables
creating tasks, subtasks and checklists.

Before using it, I had tested various task managers, such as Jira, Trello,
Asana. There were a dozen of them approximately. Worksection appeared to be
the most convenient and suitable for my tasks. Here you can track the time,
delimit information by projects by defining what is to be seen by the client,
and what is visible to the employees, contractors and freelancers.

Once our team grew to consist of 3 persons, we decided that we needed to
monitor the amount of time consumed for each project. We started from selling
hourly work and time tracking.

  

### What is the way most agencies usually operate?

**They collect a dozen of projects per employee** by charging each client for
approximately the same amount of money. But there are different clients. Some
of them “tug” us and create new tasks, while other ones do not do it. And not
always are the “tugging” clients more capable of paying.

  

There are clients who pay more without “tugging”. Eventually, in standard
agencies noone deals with clients who are “tugging” and making pressure,
although such clients are more valuable for the agency: they pay more, enhance
the growth potential, and prolong the life cycle.

  

> Most of our clients do not “tug” us, thus**time tracking turns into an
> honest process.** Depending on the amount of money paid by a client in a
> month, we allocate the necessary amount of time to handle such client’s
> project.

  

## What is exactly the way you track work hours in your agency?

Everything is ultimately transparent with the time tracking. The employees are
interested to track time, because it affects their motivation program. Clients
understand that money is paid not just for the sake of it.

**Time tracking** is the most appropriate metric within the agency. You end up
selling people’s time.

Time tracking makes us understand which projects require involving more
employees, which employees have an insufficient task load, and, on the
contrary, who of them are overloaded.

We decided to digitize most of the indicators.

  

  

## What is the way you keep records with Worksection?

We used to do it as follows: once we got paid by our client, we added the
project time inside Worksection and made sure we stayed within that time.

By using Worksection API, we obtained the following data: the amount of time
and the range of tasks tracked by each employee. We download this information
in Google Docs. Based on this information, we made up four managerial reports.

  

**4 reports in Worksection**

  * **Worksection’s “Report by People” is the first report.**

It is a summary table showing the number of hours tracked by each employee
every day. This report also reveals the approximate number of hours to be
tracked by such employee if he/she works with the same efficiency.

  

![](/images/upload/Roman_UA_by_people.@x1.png)  

The report shows the amount of hours paid by the client, as well as the number
of agent tasks. I can also see the turnover for me to obtain for a day and for
a month. Other things the report displays are: which employees, for instance,
work more actively as the week begins to get tired by the end of it. On the
contrary, another team member may track more hours per day by the end of a
month.

  * **Worksection Projects is the second report.**

It enables us to monitor the time remaining for a definite project. Based on
such report, we notify our client or account manager. The script checks the
amount of hours per day we may ultimately spend, the amount of hours spent and
how many of them remain.

Based on this report, the account manager can transfer employees to another
project, to slow down somebody or vice versa – to accelarate someone’s work.

  

  

  * **Worksection Speed is the third report.**

It shows the number of hours currently sold, the amount of hours to be paid by
clients (from amongst the post-payment clients), as well as the amount of
hours we track for a day.

  

![](/images/upload/Roman_UA_report.@x1.png)  

  

According to the report, I understand if we have collected all post-payment
money early in the month, the volume of advance sales and, possibly,
additional resources (employees) are to be involved.

  * **Worksection Rate is the fourth and the most sopfisticated report.**

Such report takes data from the previous three reports and makes a total
calculation. In the report, we have created separate tabs for different
contracts. In the work process, the client may switch from one contract to
another. For instance, after having a fixed price, he may decide to opt for
hourly remuneration.

> As a result, we calculate the rate for each project, on a monthly basis, by
> project managers and by the payment method (hourly, monthly remuneration or
> a fixed price list).

**Reports help us** understand the points where resources are deficient, where
profitability is in decline, where the project manager fails to sustain the
workload, where we have badly sold the service, or where the project includes
more work than the client has paid. We have all these on our fingertips.

  

  

### What project management methodologies do you use in your digital agency?

In SCRUM, only Daily Scrum Meeting is used fo far to synchronize the team. The
rest includes tasks, subtasks and checklists. There is a knowledge database on
Google resources. Worksection contains project templates in English and
Russian.

  

While starting a new project, we copy tasks and subtasks referring to the
knowledge database. There are checklists and repeated tasks inside.

  

![](/images/upload/Roman_UA_checklists.@x1.png)  

  

In Daily Scrum Meeting, we discuss the following things from morning: what was
done yesterday, what we are planning to do today, which bottlenecks we have
overcome and the amount of time tracked.

  

Every morning, I open reports in Daily Scrum Meeting to understand at once the
situation we have. Depending on the data, we can make important micro moves
and corrections at once.

If the reports show that some client is not profitable, we politely offer new
terms of cooperation (a new package) or terminate our collaboration.

  

  

### What is the speed of new empoyees’ mastering Worksection?

Everyone fills in profiles, adds contacts and profile pictures at ease. The
adaptation process takes some time, when employees learn how to view tasks
correctly: how to open the task tab, how to review a previous day’s report for
in Daily Scrum Meeting. The training flows smoothly, without my personal
involvement.

If someone has questions about Worksection, the colleagues will always be
there to help.

  

## Has your team generated an internal project management culture?

For most of employees,**motivation is based on hours.** Thus, our system is
structured as follows:

  

If you want to get a monthly motivation in the ultimate amount, you should
track a certain number of hours per month, per day. **There is no other way
but tracking time** , logging in tasks and subtasks, commenting the process.

  

  

### Is it easy to «lead» contractors into the Worksection system?

  

Some people oppose, once introduced in the system – they express gratitude for
years and say that they cannot imagine another way to work.

We have correctly constructed information flows,as well as repeated tasks and
checklists. It would be impossible but for a single system to operate in.
Everyone should remain in the same information flow, in the same system.

    
    
    In general, the adaptation is going well. 

There are people who are more into handling cards, for instance, by dragging
them in Kanban. They are used to work in Trello or Asana. And here we are,
keen on three levels of inserts in Worksection, where we can specify
everything.

  

  

### Do you use Worksection notifications by email or Telegram?

  

What we use is e-mail. Indeed, our company has a strong e-mail culture.

Personally, I receive about 1000 letters per month from Worksection. I am
subscribed to many tasks. I do control and track them. Telegram is convenient
if you receive 5-10 notifications per week.

  

  

### How many people are connected to Worksection now?

We have connected [more than 300 persons] to Worksection. We demand at least
one person from every client to log in tasks and do monitoring.

  

> We noticed that if the client is out of the loop, he cannot feel the value
> of what we do, and our work for him is an underground part of the iceberg.

When the client tracks everything, he understand which tasks have been solved
by us, what has been done, how much time has been consumed etc.

immediately become cost-effective and efficient.
