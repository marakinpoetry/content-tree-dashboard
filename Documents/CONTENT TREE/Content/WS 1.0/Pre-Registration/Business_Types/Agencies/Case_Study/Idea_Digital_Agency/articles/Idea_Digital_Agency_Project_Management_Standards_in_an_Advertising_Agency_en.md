# Idea Digital Agency: 
Project Management Standards 
in an Advertising Agency

## About us

  * Marketing agency
  * 19 employees
  * SEO promotion, PPC, SMM, Targeting
  * More than 2 years in the industry
  * More than 90 successfully implemented projects

**[Yulia Belitskaya](https://www.facebook.com/bilytskayulia)** , the co-
founder and marketing director of the **[Idia
Digital](https://ideadigital.agency/)** company, will outline the way the
marketing team optimize their work, and the tools they use for such purpose.

  

**Yulia is uncovering further information about the company, task trackers and
helpful tools for digital activities.**

  

## Who we are

**[Idea Digital](https://ideadigital.agency/)** appeared for creativity, for
paving accurate strategies, for creating bright websites, memorable
advertising campaigns which “shoot” exactly at the target.

  

**Idea Digital** deals with SEO, PPC and promotes customers’ companies in
social media.

Over 2018, we implemented more than 70 projects, our team grew up to 19
persons, and we developed more than 90 creative projects for customers.

  

As early as at the initial stage, when the team consisted of only several
persons, tasks were set via a messenger, namely Telegram. It makes it
convenient to hold dialogues with employees and customers, but it fails to
enable us to conduct full-scale team work.

  

We reached the point where we needed a full-scale system to manage projects of
a marketing agency.

## We searched for it, and we found it

We started our acquaintance with the world of trackers together with Trellо.
It is a convenient task tracker for a small advertising company. However the
company has grown up, and Trello’s functionality became insufficient. Then we
switched to Asana, but it is expensive, and it failed to take flight in the
team.

  

We found Worksection, tried it for the trial period, and**it worked out for
us.**

  

### How to accustom the team to work through task trackers?

It was not easy at the first stages. What helped us in adaptation was a short
description for the employees following which is necessary to accustom them.
Consistent people capable of planning got used to Worksection quite easily.

  

> Over a month, we systematized all processes in the company: from simple task
> setting to employees’ reports in Worksection. Then it became up and running.

  

For a leader, the task tracker is an indispensable tool to support projects
and to track results. Worksection facilitates project management in the
advertising agency.

  

You can deal with clients, with your team, exchange documents, set tasks to
each other, track deadlines and send reports. Worksection contributes to
reconsidering the management of digital projects.

  

## Management became easier

We divided all participants into teams, such as website development
department, marketing department, HR department and other internal teams.

  

**In the “teams” section, the following items are conveniently placed:**

  1. Team name.
  2. The list of team members with contact details and positions.

### Deadlines

In Worksection, it is convenient not only to communicate and set tasks, but
also to track their timely completion. So, when you log in Worksection, the
project task list immediately indicates tasks where we meet deadlines and
those with pressing deadlines.

> Due to Worksection, I keep my finger on the pulse and know when I have to
> get involved in order to railroad stagnant processes and to help the team.

  

  

### Labels

We have created a set of labels for tasks, and we actively use them inside the
system. We have assigned a definite set for each project, and now we label
tasks to quickly understand the stage and type of a work.

### Kanban board

In the marketing agency, tasks are managed on “kanban boards” where work is
done stage by stage. Our Worksection-based kanban is configured to display
planned and preparative tasks, tasks for approval, tasks in progress and the
final stage – reports.

  

{Example}: after a task is discussed, it can be dragged from the “planned”
stage

to the “in progress” stage where our specialist prepares the work and

discusses its progress with the client.
