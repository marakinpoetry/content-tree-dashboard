# Miller: How Lawyers Migrated from Bitrix24 in Two Weeks

**Oleksii Nosov,** a partner at the [Miller law
firm](https://millerlawfirm.ua/en/), told us about the specifics of the law
firm's work, the benefits of using Worksection for their workflows, and how
they managed to migrate from Bitrix24.

### Quick reference:

[**Miller**](https://millerlawfirm.ua/en/) is a Ukrainian law firm that
operates in the following areas: criminal practice, economic and service
crimes practice, litigation practice, and business protection practice.

## Migration in two weeks…

Before the full-scale invasion, we were using Bitrix24. However, after the
events of February 24, we decided to radically change the system, because of
its Russian origin. That's when we found
[Worksection](https://worksection.com/en/). Migrating the entire team from a
system that had been used for several years was a significant stress, as any
manager would know, but there were no problems with Worksection. We migrated
with the team, which at that time consisted of 24 people, **in just two
weeks.** It also helped that Worksection has a convenient import feature for
all tasks and contacts.

  

Starting from **June 1,** the russian service **Bitrix24 ceases its operation
in Ukraine.** Our team has designed a convenient migration of your data to
Worksection so that you can quickly resume work without losing time and data.
We will advise you on all issues and **help you with the transition.**

## How exactly does Worksection help your team?

We track cases in the system, monitor them and handle billing. Our lawyers
**work on an hourly basis,** so it is very important for us to track the time
and work of each employee, since our lawyers have high hourly rates.
Previously we did it using timesheets, but this is extremely inconvenient. If
you have ever tried to track time in timesheets, you know what I mean. In
Worksection, we have the option to add time to tasks and a **time tracker**
that helps to fix the hourly payment directly within the task, which is very
convenient for both reporting and clients.

## What is the greatest value for you as a legal company?

###### The nature of legal work is that you need to see the history of cases.
Currently, the company has 34 employees and it is necessary to see everyone's
tasks, deadlines, what has been accomplished and what is planned. Worksection
deals with these issues: we can monitor projects, tasks, workloads among
employees, and get reports on the time spent.

Communication on a case is very convenient because it is contextual and is
conducted not in separate work chats, but directly in the task. This way, even
new employees can simply enter the task and immediately understand what was
happening and start execution.

  

In our company we have several areas of activity. With the help of a
convenient time tracking in Worksection, we understand in which direction we
invest our time and which area is more profitable for us. This gives us an
understanding of which direction needs developing.

Each lawyer in Worksection sees only the projects related to his specific
area. However, there are cases when the question concerns different areas of
law. Therefore, we have **overlapping projects** where several practices
collaborate. For such cases, in Worksection we can configure the visibility of
projects, participants, collaborators and viewers by adding people from other
departments to a specific project.

  

Another issue that Worksection helps us with is the **task distribution by
their complexity.** We use labels to allocate tasks between specialists of
different levels: Junior, Middle, Senior.

  

All data from Worksection can easily be exported separately for accounting and
for financial analysis.

  

We also use the "contacts" feature to work with contractors.

## Do you have internal rules regarding the use of Worksection?

Yes, we have our **internal company rules, including how we use Worksection.**
This is standardized and described in a separate document. When an employee
has completed a task, he must write down what was done and when, as well as
describe the next step. All this is recorded in the comments to the task.

## Would you recommend Worksection to other companies?

Absolutely! We have been searching for a **Ukrainian system of such quality**
for a long time. We even considered developing our own. However, there are no
equivalents to Worksection in the Ukrainian market.
