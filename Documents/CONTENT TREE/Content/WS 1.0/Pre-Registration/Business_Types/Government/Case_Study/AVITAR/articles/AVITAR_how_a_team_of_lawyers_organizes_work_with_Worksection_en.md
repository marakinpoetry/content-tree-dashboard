# AVITAR: how a team of lawyers organizes work with Worksection

**Yevhen Saveliev,** managing partner of the
[**Avitar**](https://www.avitar.legal/en/team) law company, spoke about the
work of the team with Worksection, the value of the service for lawyers and
the advantages of time tracking.

## Tell us about your company and your customers

[Avitar](https://www.avitar.legal/en/team) is an international online business
law firm. **Our specialization** is support for IT companies that are
developing and expanding to the markets of the EU, USA, and Great Britain. We
help with Corporate & Tax, Data Protection & Marketing compliance, as well as
support investment agreements.

  

The company was formed in 2018, when Myroslav, my partner, completely left in-
house. That is, now **our company is 5 years old.**

In 2022, our team grew a lot, but then we started making mistakes, someone
burned out, and people started quitting. Most likely, this happened because we
were inexperienced entrepreneurs who made **many mistakes within the
organization.** Therefore, our company is going through difficult times.

## How did you come to Worksection?

I got a little tired of keeping financial statements in Excel, I wanted some
beauty, aesthetics and a human face concerning managing information. As a
result, **we came to Worksection** because it makes the most sense for a
business like ours. 1C is complex, Excel often does not provide the kind of
infographic you need. In addition, we wanted to support Ukrainian business.

## What service tools help you in your work?

It's great that Worksection allows you to track time. It is cool to be able
**to manage working hours.** When you grow, you don't count money in small
things, who works how much. And then, when you get more people, with larger
wages, you start a cash gap. Then you start to worry about which employee is
working on which project, or whether they are working on projects that are not
profitable for us.

###### Time tracker in Worksection

  

If you start something like tracking time and money, then be prepared that
**the team will rebel.** That was, in fact, one of the reasons why we failed:
because we implemented it too late. But it gives excellent feedback on the
efficiency of your business.

  

We also actively use the **Gantt chart.** It is an essential tool when working
with long-term projects with 20, 50 or more tasks.

## “With Worksection you know who, when, where and how much...…”

We are one of the best in the market when it comes to **protecting personal
data.** In this case, we made a compromise: we still store information in our
databases, and use Worksection as a port, because this system is for other
tasks. We do not use it for large storage, as there is still email and a large
number of email-associated documents.

  

Worksection, as a tool, solves another problem: with it, it is clear **who,
when, where and how much.** For us, it's about money, responsible people, time
and making everything clear.

  

I tell everyone right away that we work with Worksection. I can't even think
of anything else.
