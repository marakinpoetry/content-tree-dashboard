# UGS®: 
The Way Worksection is Used in 
Geological Exploration

**[The UGS® Company](http://ugs.ua/) operates in the field of geological
exploration, rendering a full range of services necessary for mineral
developers.**

**This company has managed to combine the expertise of experienced geologists,
ecologists, hydrogeologists, technicians and engineers with a creative
approach, enthusiasm and desire for innovation of young professionals and
students.**

  

> I am not very good at software, but I can say many good things. At the
> moment, I cannot just imagine how we would do without it.

We have been using Worksection for about 4 months already. We are currently
handling 89 projects through it, and each project involves 5-6 people or more
simultaneously.

  

We used to simply forget, overlook or lose some tasks with such amount of
work. Then we were criticized by our clients, had to apologize to them for
having failed unintentionally, for not having sent it all overnight after
doing everything, and we ended up reworking tasks like students.

  

It is all over now. Sometimes deadlines are really missed. But owing to
Worksection, we see that

the reason is not someone’s omission, whereas the problem might be wrong
deadlines or priorities initially set. Another variant might be lack of
people, but it is easy to add them in a project.

When we needed, we found the head of the company within half an hour, he
looked deeply into our problems and helped us to solve them. We had no
difficulties in communication with the managers, which often occurs when such
programs are used.

  

Whereas it is so difficult to get into ear of an administrator who answers
questions in a manner like: “Don’t you understand? Read more attentively,
everything is written there, click the green button”, we do not have such
problems with Worksection. Moreover, quite rarely did we have to contact the
administrators, because immediately after the launch, we were given all links
to video lessons explaining everything clearly and comprehensibly.

  

Being a geological company mainly preferring the underground to fine and
advanced information technologies, we found it simple and understandable. Now
we are ready to recommend orksection to everybody, what we are basically
doing!
