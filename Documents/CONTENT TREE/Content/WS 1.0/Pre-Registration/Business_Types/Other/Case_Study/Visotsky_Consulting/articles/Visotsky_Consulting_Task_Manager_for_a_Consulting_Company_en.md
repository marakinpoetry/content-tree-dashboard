# Visotsky Consulting: Task Manager 
for a Consulting Company

## Summary

The main resources for any company are time, money and people. It is important
to plan and track the employees’ working hours, to oversee the company’s
expenses and to plan projects wisely.

## About us:

  * Consulting agency;
  * **120 employees** in the CIS sector;
  * More than **10 years** in the market;
  * More than **500 successful projects** ;
  * **Clients:** Czech Post Print House, BogushTime, Water Energy, Global Security Technologies etc.

  

### Your company should work for you, not you for it

**Visotsky Consulting** has been operating since 2008. Our purpose is simple —
to help small and medium businesses to evolve, and for this purpose, we train
entrepreneurs to manage efficiently in the programme-based course in our
**School for Business Owners**. Visotsky Consulting operates in Ukraine,
Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, America and Taiwan.

The school for business owners represents a 12-month consulting project in
which we teach business founders how to manage a company. **More than 500
companies** have already graduated.

  

  

## Why Worksection?

Hereafter, Anastasia Melnikova will present you the way to select a management
system for a consulting company:

  

The main resources for any company are **time, money and people**. It is
important to plan and track the employees’ working hours, to oversee the
company’s expenses and to plan projects wisely.

  

To work on projects entirely, and to supervise employees, company managers use
project management projects, or, more simply, task trackers.

  

Task tracker is a program for tracking the company’s activities. It enables
setting tasks, deadlines, monitoring task statuses and analysing the company’s
efficiency.

Microsoft Planner is our first task tracker. It is simple and convenient, but
we lacked integrations with Google services utilized by the whole company.
Then we switched to Bitrix24.

  

Bitrix represented the greatest complexity, since we needed to hire
specialists to have it adapted and introduced. We ended up spending a lot of
money, efforts and several months to adjust and rework the system to fit our
needs. We obtained a complicated and overloaded tool which was meant by us to
cover all requirements of the company, such as project management, marketing
and interaction of all employees.

  

  

### We needed a tool with the following features:

  * **simple interface** to enable each employee to figure it out as promptly as possible;
  * **flexible structure of projects** with tasks, subtasks and checklists;
  * **task customization:** priorities, deadlines, lables and responsible executives;
  * **planning tools:** Gantt chart, Kanban boards, calendar and time tracking;
  * **report system** — plan/actual on tasks for a week;
  * **Russian, Ukrainian and English interfaces** to simplify adaptation of all branches in CIS and other contries;
  * **mobile application** for swift feedback from employees directly from the smartphone.

  

### Result

We considered many task trackers, but we found the right tool in the Ukrainian
market. For more than a year, we have been using **Worksection** as the main
tool to manage consulting projects. This is a simple and intuitive project
management system for an affordable price. Due to the multilingual support,
Worksection is integrated in our overseas branches.

### Which aids do you use?

We have strategic planning, weekly planning, and daily coordinations at
various levels, depending on the department. In Worksection, we handle all
projects of the company, and the following aids facilitate it:

  

  * **Calendar**

For our company’s team, integration with Google Calendar was very significant.
Worksection’s calendar hosts planning of regular activities and coordination
of works, and, once synchronized, all data are displayed in the employees’
personal Google calendars.

  * **Task list**

Worksection helps in monitoring a person’s workload. Seing the number of tasks
in an employee’s project, we can estimate the amount of work to be done by
them additionally.

  * **Priorities**

We actively use task priorities. In Worksection, we can set a task priority
from 1 to 10, but we have chosen a simple gradation of priorities:

  

  

[1] — for regular tasks;

  

[5] — for simple tasks;

  

[10] — for tasks to be urgently fulfilled.

  * **Gantt Chart**

To have demonstrative action plans, we use the Gantt Chart. The table
excellently visualizes task deadlines within one project. Along with
displaying planned deadlines in the table, the chart makes it possible to
manipulate them at ease.

  * **Reports**

On a weekly basis, we view the same total number of tasks in each project as
completed in the previous week, as well as the number of urgent tasks in the
project. We take all data from Worksection-based reports.

  

  1. The number of tasks planned in the project;
  2. The number of tasks completed in the project;
  3. Urgent tasks in the project (marked with a red point).

## Data privacy and dealing with clients

Primarily, we find out if our clients take advantage of task trackers. If they
do, we add such client in Worksection. To make the activities of the client
company visible for us, we get connected to their projects. In such way, we
can track their development, analyze the client’s activities, set tasks for
them and participate in discussions.

  

Worksection ensures privacy, and it really helps. All confidential data and
internal projects of our company are invisible for the client by default. The
privacy settings are very flexible, and each task may be hidden from a
definite number of people.

## To whom will you recommend Worksection?

I would recommend introducing Worksection to all owners of small and medium
businesses. At the stage of having at least 2 managers in charge of the
company’s evolution, the sequence, deadlines and even tasks tend to be
forgotten. Not only does Worksection remember all project-related information,
it also makes it possible to analyze the company’s performance.
