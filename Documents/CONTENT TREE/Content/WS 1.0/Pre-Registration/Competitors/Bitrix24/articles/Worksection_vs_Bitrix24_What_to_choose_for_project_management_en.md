# Worksection vs Bitrix24: What to 
choose for project management

**Bitrix24** is a russian product. That's why using this system is tantamount
to supporting the aggressor country since the beginning of russia's invasion
of Ukraine.

  

Bitrix24 is usually chosen by sales teams that need to organize **simple
linear processes.**  
  
**Worksection,** on the other hand, offers a **full set of project management
tools,** including a time tracker and kanban boards. Today we'll look at the
capabilities of both services, taking into account specific business needs.

## Who can use Worksection and Bitrix24

### Worksection

####  _{Consider Worksection if}_

  * **You are a small or medium-sized business with 10 to 100 people on your team.** Worksection is perfectly suited to the needs of small and medium-sized teams. The system easily adapts to the growth of your business, ensuring stability of processes and structuring of work tasks.
  * **You want to control the workload of your team.** Responsibilities, deadlines, and the status of current tasks — all in one place. View information about team activity on demand. Use reports to compare planned and actual workloads. Gantt charts and people diagrams help spread the workload evenly across the team.

#### _[​ You should check alternatives if]_

  * ​**You are in need of a CRM system** and not a project management service. Worksection is designed for business process management and does not include CRM functionality.
  * **You are looking for a service with built-in chat and video conferencing.** Communication in Worksection takes place within tasks to maintain process efficiency. Additional services may be required to integrate chat and video conferencing.

### ​Bitrix24

####  _​{ Bitrix24 is for you if}_

  * ​**You need a tool for organizing your sales team's work.** Bitrix24 tools provide effective lead and customer data management and are ideal for sales team tasks.
  * **You are looking for a CRM system** that also has basic task manager functionality. Bitrix24 combines the capabilities of a CRM system with a minimal set of task management tools to provide you with a complete CRM solution.

#### _​[ Consider other services if]_

  * ​**You do not support the occupier.** russia is a terrorist state. Using Bitrix24 means supporting a russian company financially. If you do not want to help the aggressor country, you should choose alternative solutions.
  * **You are in search of a project management solution.** For the organization of complex workflows, Bitrix24 has limited functionality. As a result, the system is not suitable for full-scale project management.
  * **You want to work on an hourly basis.** Bitrix24's time tracking and reporting capabilities are not sufficient for the effective management of hourly work. Therefore, service companies should consider alternative solutions.
