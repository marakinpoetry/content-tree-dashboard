# Comparison: 
Bitrix24 vs Worksection

Due to the full-scale war against Ukraine initiated by the Russian Federation
on February 24, 2022, companies in Ukraine and around the world are massively
abandoning Russian-made services and products. Project management systems and
CRM systems are no exception.

  

One of the most popular CRM systems and task managers previously used in
Ukraine is the Russian Bitrix24. Recently, our support service has been
receiving frequent questions about which service can [replace
Bitrix](https://worksection.com/en/migration/bitrix24.html) and whether our
system can serve as an alternative to Bitrix24. We have analyzed other
Bitrix24 alternatives in this article.

  

In this article, we compared the capabilities of Worksection and Bitrix24 for
project and task management, time tracking, and organizing collaborative work,
specifically their features, functions, and usage costs, to simplify the
process of quickly and comfortably transitioning from one system to another
for you.

## Brief Overview of the Platforms

**Bitrix24 —** One of the former leaders in Ukraine and the CIS in the
business management tools market, a multi-tasking system for client work,
project management, and a CMS for creating and promoting your own website.

get used to the interface. Most functions are likely not to be used. The
functionality also requires additional customization to meet the company's
needs, which means additional implementation and support costs.

developed by a Ukrainian team. The service can be easily and quickly
implemented, and it is simple to manage projects of various complexities and
for any business profile. Worksection is suitable for companies that need a
unified platform for project planning and client work.

  

During wartime, our company provides free access to the service for all
volunteer organizations and humanitarian teams that need a system to
coordinate actions.

client work and project planning.

## Simplicity and Features

  * **Bitrix24** is a global corporate system. At first glance, everything might seem simple. However, if you try to implement the system in your company, you may encounter problems.

​Bitrix24 users on Startpack (an information resource in Russia) note poor
reliability and inconvenience of functionality: "Basic menu 'change direction'
of deals disappears in half of the employees. And this is within one
department with full rights."

  

  * **Worksection** is available in a web browser or smartphone app. The easy-to-learn interface allows any employee to stay on top of the work process, get the necessary information about project development and assigned tasks.

​With the basic Worksection plan, your team gets access to business management
tools, work time organization, communication, extended reporting, and resource
expenditure analysis tools.

## Tasks and Projects

  * **Bitrix24** contains functionality for managing businesses of various categories. It's a multi-tasking system for client work, project management, and CMS for creating and promoting your own website. Bitrix24 includes many features, and its interface is overloaded with capabilities that are not directly related to project management.

​Worksection is suitable for teams that need a simple tool that can be
customized to their processes. For quick project status analysis, the system
has introduced a new functionality - Project Dashboard. The section includes
several indicators that allow you to comprehensively control the progress of
the project, analyze team involvement, account for time and financial
expenditures, and gather quick statistics for team meetings.

  

**Bitrix24** is designed for comprehensive business servicing. It's a bulky
and complex portal that, when used, confronts you with a vast number of
capabilities, many of which you won't need. This can be a problem for your
employees who want to use a simpler tool.

  

  * **Worksection** is an online service for planning and controlling projects that works quickly, reliably, and with excellent technical support. Conveniently, when switching to Worksection from another task manager, all your projects, tasks, and attached files can be automatically imported.

Worksection is suitable for your team's work, considering its specifics and
main needs.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
