## ​Who can use Worksection and Asana?

​Common features in project management systems do not make them **suitable for
all types of organizations.** As well as management tools, you should also
consider

  

  1. **Your team size and the specifics of your business.** The number of employees and the types of tasks you perform on a daily basis. 
  2. **Your request.** Why do you need to implement the system: you need to manage time and resources; you need to control the stages of developing a product; you need to centralize work to be able to communicate effectively with customers. 

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Let's take a look at**the main features of the platforms.** This helps you to
make a comparison between them.

### Worksection

####  _{You are guaranteed to get 'matched' with Worksection if}_

  * **You are a small or medium-sized company.** Worksection is perfect for organizing teams of 10 to 100 people.
  * **If you are just starting to manage your projects in a more consistent way.** Worksection is not overloaded with unnecessary functions and settings, so it can be your guide to the world of project management.
  * **You run a service business and work with your clients on an hourly basis.** And you need to keep track of time and resources. Built-in time tracking and automated reporting make Worksection an essential tool for hourly based service teams.
  * **Customer focus is important to you.** Worksection provides live chat support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, rather than the chatbot answers of competing solutions.
  * **You have a limited software budget.** Worksection starts at $2.5 per user, which is much lower than competing solutions. At the same time, you have access to all the same features: task manager, kanban board, Gantt chart, etc.

#### _​[You should consider alternatives to Worksection]_

  * **​ If you are a technical team with a need for DevOps support.** Worksection has limited functionality to fully control the product lifecycle and is more suitable for general project management and organization of non-technical teams.
  * **If you are looking for a pre-built template solution for a specific organization.** The Worksection functionality does not provide the user with ready-made templates for project completion. 
  * **If you are in need of a system for the organization of your sales department's work with customers and telephony.** In that case, you should pay attention to the CRM systems. Worksection is designed for managing projects and does not support working with customer databases or integrating telephony systems.

### Asana

  * **You are looking for a system that comes with pre-built templates.** Asana has over 80 templates based on common workflows and management practices.
  * **You have a desire to customize the system to make it work for you.** Use custom fields to add additional information to tasks in your Asana projects.
  * **You are prepared to pay more.** Asana is priced higher than average, so you need to be prepared to make a significant financial investment. 

####  _​[Look for an alternative to Asana if]_

  * **​ You're on a budget. **The price of $10.99 per user may be overwhelming for small teams and startups.  

  * **You want live, real-time support.** Asana provides its customers with support bots and ticketing systems. As a result, there is sometimes a problem getting quick answers.
