# Use Worksection to the fullest. Part 2: 
Data migration, Automation, 
Non-obvious features

###### This is the second part of the article about Worksection features.
[Follow the link](https://worksection.com/en/blog/use-worksection-to-the-
fullest-part-1.html) to read the first part.

## Data Migration and Automation

Worksection's functionality simplifies the process of **migrating from other
systems, importing and exporting information.**

### [Migration]

There is a convenient feature in the **" Import"** section of your account
settings if you are migrating from another system.

  

![](/images/upload/Settings_part2_2_eng.@x1_3.png)  

Select the tool you are migrating from and transfer data to Worksection. **You
can do migration from these services:** Trello, Asana, Jira, MS Project and
more!

### [Task Import and Export]

To **export** or **import** data, you need to go to the settings and select
the appropriate option.

The next step is to select the document format that you want to import or
export and the proper set of settings for the data transfer.

  

This allows you to export and save **any page in the system,** including
reports. When exporting reports, you also have a list of criteria by which you
can download information, **including the following categories:** tasks,
expenses, author, responsible, project.

## ​Automation of Data Transfer: Webhooks та Zapier

​Use **Webhooks and Zapier** to connect Worksection with other services.

### [Webhooks]

**Webhooks** automatically send information to a web address of your choice
when something changes in your account. This means you can get updated without
delay. [Learn more about
Webhooks.](https://worksection.com/en/blog/webhooks.html)

Google Sheets, GitHub, SaleForce, MailChimp, Zendesk, Dropbox, and more.

## ​Non-obvious Features

### ​​[Account Menu]

​The Account menu is located **in the top right corner** and displays
notifications, projects, tasks, and bookmarks.

  

![](/images/upload/Settings_part2_7_eng.@x1.png)  

  * **Notifications.** Click the bell to view system notifications. 
  * **My Projects and Tasks.** Sections displaying all your available projects and tasks. This makes it easy for you to switch between them.
  * **Bookmarks**. Save your most frequently viewed pages in this section.
  * **Search.** Search is the place where you can find any information in the system by keyword search.

#### ​Notification filters

​You can filter notifications according **to the following categories:**
mention, task, task closure, comment, file. This helps you not to miss
important information when you have a heavy workload.

### ​[Access to Google Drive]

​You can easily share files stored on a disk within the system by providing
access to Google Drive.

### ​[Communication]

​Communication in Worksection takes place **within the task**. We would like
to highlight the following non-obvious features of comments

  1. The Shift+3 shortcut to recall a task;
  2. Setting up comment filters;
  3. The ability to publish hidden comments.

### ​[Task history]

​By clicking on the **" three dots",** then **" more"** and selecting the **"
task history" **section, you can view the history of a task. All actions that
occur within the task are included in the task history.

### ​[Filters and bookmarks]

**​ The Worksection filter** is a handy tool for separating the information
you need from the general data stream.

  

![](/images/upload/12_Filtry_kh1.@x1_1.gif)  

In Worksection, you can save filter parameters for quick access to
information:

#### Option #1

Open the context menu in the filter pane, select "**Bookmarks "**, create a
suitable name, and click "**Save "**.

  

![](/images/upload/13_Zakladky_kh1.@x1_1.gif)​​​​​​​

#### Option #2

Go to the "**Bookmarks " **personal menu and click the star at the bottom of
the screen. Name the page and click the "**Save " **button.

### [​Help and Hotkeys]

​​​Use the **" Help"** button to find a link to the FAQ section of the
service. You can also write to technical support and find other useful
materials.

**The list of hotkeys** that you can use to improve your user experience is
the most interesting part of this section:

## ​How to use it?

​Firstly, understand that you don't need to use **every****features all at
once.** Start by getting familiar with the information and testing the
features that you find most interesting and effective.

  

Our advice is to use the system in **accordance with your company's needs.**
This means that you don't need to adapt to the structure of the service, but
the service will adapt to your needs. In this way, you will get a real
assistant in the organization of your work process.

  

**_Good luck!_**
