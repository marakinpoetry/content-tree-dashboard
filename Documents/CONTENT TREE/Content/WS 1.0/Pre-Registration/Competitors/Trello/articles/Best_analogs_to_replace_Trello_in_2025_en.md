# Best analogs to replace Trello in 2025

Trello is one of the most user-friendly tools for small teams. Intuitive
kanban boards make it easy to visualize workflows. All work within a project
is divided into specific stages.

  

A manager can check the team's workload at any time and be sure of the status
of tasks. In this way Trello simplifies the planning and control of work
execution.

## Why are users looking for alternatives to Trello?

Although the system's capabilities are extensive, they may still be
insufficient for some teams. Some of the popular reasons for looking for
alternatives to Trello are: scalability issues, insufficient tools,
limitations in customization and building complex processes.

### Top reasons to look for an alternative to Trello in 2025

#### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/0031-fe0f-20e3.png) Limited capacity for complex
workflows

Trello does not support multi-level tasks and subtasks. In addition, the
system lacks a Gantt chart for planning timelines and tracking dependencies
between tasks. These limitations of Trello make it difficult to manage complex
projects.

#### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/0032-fe0f-20e3.png) Insufficient set of tools for
resource control

Trello does not have built-in tools for time tracking and resource management.
They are important for service business owners to analyze where the team's
focus is directed. Having a time tracker allows you to highlight inefficient
resource allocation and calculate the cost of work.

  

The [Worksection timer](https://worksection.com/en/time-tracker.html) is
available on all paid plans. With its help, a business can control the amount
of time spent on a task and plan its work based on facts.

#### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/0033-fe0f-20e3.png) Scalability issues

The lack of hierarchical task structure in Trello can cause chaos in
workflows. Therefore, as the team grows and the number of projects increases,
the use of Trello may become less efficient.

#### ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-
apple@14.0.0/img/apple/64/0034-fe0f-20e3.png) Limited opportunities for
integration and customization

Extending Trello functionality often requires the use of third-party plugins
and integrations. This also implies additional costs and efforts for
customization and integration, which not everyone can afford.

### How do other tools address these issues?

As a result, companies are looking for more flexible Trello alternatives that
better meet business objectives and allow for more efficient project
management.

  

**​For example, Worksection's functionality offers:**

  * **Advanced task management capabilities:** Worksection provides not only kanban boards but also Gantt charts, allowing you to plan and track complex projects with timelines and dependencies.
  * **Time and resource management:** The integrated time tracker and reporting system helps to control time and resource costs, which is especially important for service companies.

In addition to Worksection, there are a number of alternatives to Trello. Each
platform offers useful features for different business tasks.

  

If you need agile task management and process automation, **Asana, ClickUp and
Monday.com** are great choices. They support Agile methodologies, Gantt charts
and SCRUM boards, and offer built-in reports and analytics without the need
for external integrations.

  

For technical teams working with DevOps, **Jira and Wrike** are optimal. They
provide deep integration with development processes, backlog, sprint and
resource management, and detailed reporting.

  

If collaboration and ease of use are important, you should choose **Basecamp
or Notion.** These platforms offer a minimalistic interface, task organization
and record keeping, which is ideal for small teams and freelancers.

## Criteria for selecting a project and team management system  

The choice of a task manager depends on the specifics of the business, team
size and key tasks. The tool should help in organizing work and at the same
time meet the company's specific requirements.

### Team size and business specifics

For small teams and startups,**simplicity and convenience** are important so
that employees quickly adapt to the new tool. Minimal functionality, a clear
interface and the ability to manage multiple tasks without complex
customization are the main criteria for selection.

  

Medium and large companies work with a large number of tasks and participants.
This requires **flexibility in customization,** the ability to manage
resources, control deadlines and integrate with other services.

  

Technical teams and developers often need **specialized tools** that support
Agile methodologies, SCRUM, process automation, and advanced analytics.

### Basic business needs

First of all, it is important to determine **what business tasks the system
should solve.** If the main goal is to organize and manage tasks, a simple
task manager with convenient process visualization will do.

  

Tools with Gantt charts, time tracking and detailed reporting are needed to
monitor deadlines, resources and dependencies between processes. If it's
important to analyze team performance, automation features, reports and
flexible performance metrics are useful.

### Limitations: budget and adaptation

Fees can be **flat per team** or **charged per user.** Note that some tools
also offer free plans, but their functionality may be limited.

  

It is also important to estimate the time to adapt the system. Simple
platforms can be mastered more quickly. Complex solutions may require
additional training of employees. Therefore, check the quality of technical
support and the availability of onboarding.

is important to determine which parameters are in priority for you.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Which Trello alternative is best for small businesses?

**For small teams, Worksection is one of the best alternatives to Trello.**
The platform is easy to learn and offers quality support at all stages of
work. You can turn to experts who will help you adapt the system to your
team's tasks and optimize workflows.

  

Unlike Trello, Worksection provides advanced functionality required for
effective project management. The system has built-in reports, time tracking,
task control, Gantt chart, calendar, and flexible customization of roles and
access levels. All key project management tools are gathered in one meat and
are available at a favorable price.

### Are there any free analogs to Trello?

**Yes, but with limitations.** Many services offer free plans, but they have
limited functionality, such as limiting the number of users, tasks, or file
storage. If you need access to all features, you will have to consider paid
plans.

  

Among all alternatives, Worksection offers some of the most favorable
conditions on the free plan. You can add up to 5 users and manage two projects
at the same time. You will have kanban board and task manager tools at your
disposal. This is a great solution for small teams that are just starting out
and want to test the system before a large-scale implementation.

### How is Worksection different from Trello?

**Worksection offers an extended set of built-in tools for project and
resource management,** eliminating the need for additional integrations and
costs. All core functions are already included in the platform, providing
convenience and efficiency without complex customizations.

  

One of the main advantages of Worksection over Trello is the built-in Gantt
chart. It is especially useful for industries where precise planning of
deadlines is important: construction, manufacturing, architecture. Trello
lacks this feature, which makes it difficult to control the stages of tasks on
the timeline.

  

Another important advantage is the built-in time tracker. In Trello, it is
available through third-party integrations, whereas in Worksection time
tracking is included in all paid tariffs. This helps to control employee
workload, analyze work efficiency and generate reports on used resources
without additional services.
