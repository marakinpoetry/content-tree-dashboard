## How does Trello limit business?

The benefits of a platform with a simple, intuitive interface, rich
customisation and convenient communication tools start to fade when it comes
**to scaling a business.** Existing **capabilities fall short** in organizing
collaboration for large teams.

Trello's spring update also introduces significant**limitations to the free
plan.** Workspaces will be limited to 10 participants. [From 20 May

all boards that exceed this limit will automatically switch to view mode
without the ability to edit. The same will apply to workspaces that switch
from paid to free plan.

  

Coupled with its limitations, Trello has gradually lost its edge among teams
that want control over workflow.

### Limitations of Trello include

#### [Lack of tools]

Teamwork management requires **a variety of tools** to control tasks, keep
track of time and resources, access key performance indicators, etc.
Unfortunately, **Trello doesn't provide features** that would fully cover this
need.

#### [Prevents scaling]

The platform's Kanban board system becomes**less efficient the more projects
and tasks you have.** That's because the service does not allow you to manage
processes with dependencies or complex tasks. So, as the workload grows, the
visual clarity of the boards will increasingly move towards **uncontrollable
chaos.**

#### [Tariff plan costs]

Eventually, every company will need to update their plans. But when you
compare Trello's prices to alternative services, **it's pretty high.** This is
especially the case for small teams and small businesses.

your way of working, you should have a look at alternatives with more
comprehensive tools, such as [Worksection.](https://worksection.com/en/)
