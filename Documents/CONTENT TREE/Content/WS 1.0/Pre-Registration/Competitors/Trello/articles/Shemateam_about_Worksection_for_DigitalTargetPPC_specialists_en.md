# Shema.team about Worksection for 
Digital/Target/PPC specialists

**Vadym Nevmerzhytskyi,** co-founder and CTO of
[**shema.team**](https://shema.team/) agency, shared how Worksection helps to
control the work of the PPC specialists team.

## About the company

The name **shema.team** was born out of the structured nature of the work we
do and our love of using spreadsheets. That is why the name reflects the
"schematic" way of the agency's work.

  

Our clients are mostly e-businesses from Ukraine and overseas. We
make**advertising and automation** for them. We also work with other projects
that are interesting for us.

The beginning of the company's development was in 2018, together with the
business partner. Now the team consists of **12 people.**

## "We immediately got along with Worksection"

The main request during the search at that time ( it was 2018 ) was**the
convenience of the tool from a UX point of view.** Both my business partner
and I had already had experience with a number of task managers.
Unfortunately, they were all quite disappointing, some of them were literally
a hassle to use.

  

> I had experience with Trello. The system is more straightforward and more
> suitable for simple tasks.

## Why did you choose Worksection?

We liked [**Worksection**](https://worksection.com/en/) for its Kanban board,
ability to upload tasks via CSV, time tracker and comments. We also wanted to
work with a Ukrainian product.

###### Importing tasks via CSV to Worksection

  

Therefore, we chose Worksection and have been using it **since July 2018.**

​

## Working with Worksection and Google Sheets

We create a separate Google Sheet for the project. There we make a plan of the
tasks for the month, add the estimated time, assignee, and a description of
the task with its typing. **The API automatically uploads** this to
Worksection, where the assignee can see their workload on the Kanban board.

## About time tracking and reporting

**We always use task tracking** to maintain internal efficiency. We upload
data to a google sheet so that we have an awareness of the workload and who we
can potentially assign a new project to.

## What is the value of Worksection for you?

> The value of Worksection is that I am able to understand **how much we have
> spent, either in terms of resources or money, on a particular project.**

I can highlight the**capabilities of the Worksection API** at the same level
of importance. Because it absolutely covers all our needs.

## "If you want to do something properly, you need a task manager"

I use Worksection **to control tasks:** whether the task has been completed,
what has been done, what comments have been added, whether it has been written
correctly from a technical point of view. So Worksection helps when you need
to control not only yourself but also your employees.
