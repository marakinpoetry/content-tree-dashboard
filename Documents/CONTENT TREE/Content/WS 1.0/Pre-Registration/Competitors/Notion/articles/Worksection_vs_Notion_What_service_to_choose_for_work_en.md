## Who can use Worksection and Notion?

### ​​Worksection

####  _{Worksection is suitable}_

  * **Businesses with 10 to 100 team members:** Worksection effectively manages the organization of both small and large projects, ensuring order and systematization.
  * **Service companies that work on an hourly basis:** Accurately calculate the cost of client projects, streamline processes, and increase team efficiency with the built-in timer and accountability system.
  * **For those with limited experience with project management systems:** The convenient division into projects, tasks and sub-tasks on two levels ensures a transparent organization of the business processes and makes it easier for you to get started.
  * **For those who want to work with multiple project management tools within one system:** Worksection gives you access to Kanban, Gantt Chart, reports, and a time tracker with any paid plan. This allows you to get the most out of the system, no matter which plan you choose.

#### _​[You should consider other options if]_

  * **​ You are looking for a solution with a high level of workflow automation** and templates to work with. Worksection does not provide ready-made templates for organizing work, which may be important for some users.
  * **You have a technical team and workflows that require DevOps support.** Worksection is better suited for general project management and organizing non-technical teams, as it's limited in its ability to fully control the product lifecycle.

### ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Notion

####  _​{Notion is suitable}_

  * **​ For those looking for visual clarity and simplicity: **The intuitive design of Notion helps you organize your data with its graphical design and minimal tools.
  * **For those who need customization:** Notion's greatest advantage is its versatility. Users are not limited to predefined structures and can adapt the system to their workflow.
  * **Work with databases and filters:** The ability to create structured databases and apply filters and sorting makes Notion ideal for organizations with large libraries of information and multi-format content.
  * **For those who need a variety of templates:** To save time and effort, Notion offers many templates that can be quickly integrated into projects.

#### _​[You should consider other options if]_

  * **​ You need analytics and reporting: **Notion lacks comprehensive analytics and reporting tools, making it difficult to monitor KPIs and scale results.
  * **You have a limited budget:** The limited business functionality often requires additional services to fill in the gaps, which can be financially disadvantageous for small businesses.

###### _Work­sec­tion reports and time tracker​_

####  How does it work?

There are five easy steps to implementing hourly work in Worksection:

  1. **Create a project:** Schedule a project and specify the number of hours to complete it.
  2. **Assign tasks:** Divide the project into individual tasks and use the time tracker to monitor their progress.
  3. **Con­duct a plan-to-fact analy­sis:** Analyze the resources used for individual tasks or the project as a whole. The interactive dashboard displays key metrics: total hours spent and project schedule.
  4. **Correct Workload:** Use automated reports to adjust your team's workload. Worksection allows you to customize reports to meet your needs and automatically groups all the necessary data in one place.
  5. **Control your margins:** Control margins and adjust the cost of services with Worksection's hourly billing. Grow your business through better control of resources, with visibility into workflows and their documentation.

### ​Structure

​The Worksection account is divided into **projects,** where you can
set**tasks and subtasks** of two levels. This allows you to systematize the
processes of a separate department or work on a specific client project, and
to keep all the necessary information **in one place.**

###### _Work­sec­tion task structure_

You can set the **priority of the task,** when it needs to be done and who's
**responsible** for it. In addition, you can add **labels and statuses.** This
allows you to distinguish the stage and specifics of tasks.

### Management tools

Worksection **Time Tracker** allows you to accurately track the time spent on
tasks by each employee. The system automatically generates **reports**
according to the specified parameters, allowing you to effectively plan future
projects based on the data obtained.

  

**The Gantt** chart is an indispensable tool for visualizing the progress of a
project in real time. By establishing dependencies between tasks, you can see
which process caused the delay and whether you are on track to complete the
project on time.

  

By viewing a project on a **Kanban** board, you can see how much work has been
done, which tasks the team is currently working on, and which tasks are
scheduled to be completed next. This is made possible by the convenient
organization of tasks by status and tags, which brings clarity and structure
to workflows.

### System access levels

Worksection offers an advanced system for distributing access that corresponds
to the standard team hierarchy. This provides flexibility and control over
accessing information, increasing efficiency and security.

###### _Work­sec­tion par­tic­i­pants’ permissions_

 _**For example,** an employee with the “Guest” role has access only to the
tasks for which he or she is responsible or a subscriber. This is ideal for
working with contractors._

  

### Transparent data display

Worksection provides a transparent view of all information related to project
interaction. This includes overdue dates, new tasks and their owners, and time
spent on specific tasks.

###### _Com­mu­ni­ca­tion in Worksection_

Both managers and clients will find this information useful. By customizing
their access level, you can involve clients in your projects as needed.

  

### Price

In Worksection, the price per user starts at $2.5 and each plan includes all
the basic features with varying quotas (number of people, projects, and GB).
The price per user in Notion starts at $8, but you still have certain
limitations: 30-day page history, no Customer Success Manager support, no
workspace analysis tool, etc.

  

Our customers also have the option to add premium features to their plan for
an additional $30 per month. This allows you to avoid overpaying and get the
most out of our system.
