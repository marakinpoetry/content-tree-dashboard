# Worksection Kanban vs Notion Kanban: Which Is Better for Project Management

**Kanban boards have become the standard for visualizing workflows.** But not all Kanban tools are created equal. Notion offers a flexible all-in-one workspace with Kanban views, while Worksection provides a complete project management system with integrated Kanban boards. Which tool is the better fit for your team?

In this article, we compare the Kanban capabilities of both services, examine their strengths and limitations, and help you make an informed decision.

## What Is Kanban and Why Does It Matter

### Core Components of a Kanban Board

Kanban is a visual work management method originating from Toyota's manufacturing system. The core concept is simple: **you see your entire team's work on one screen**, organized by stages of completion.

**A classic Kanban board consists of:**
- **Columns** — workflow stages (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Review," "Done")
- **Cards** — individual tasks that move between columns
- **WIP limits** — restrictions on tasks per stage to prevent overload

### Who Uses Kanban

Kanban works for teams of various sizes and industries:

- **IT companies** — tracking development and bug fixes
- **Marketing agencies** — managing creative projects and content workflows
- **Service companies** — controlling client tasks and deliverables
- **Consulting firms** — visualizing project stages and milestones

> **"Within 2 weeks of using Kanban, we reduced our development cycle from 14 to 9 days."**
> — CTO, Genesis

## Notion Kanban Overview

### Notion's Strengths

**[Notion](https://www.notion.so/)** is an all-in-one workspace that combines notes, databases, and task management. Kanban boards in Notion are one way to display database information.

**Advantages of Notion for task visualization:**

- **High customization** — create any column structure and custom fields
- **Flexible databases** — view the same data as Kanban, table, calendar, or list
- **Templates** — large library of ready-made templates for quick setup
- **Documentation integration** — tasks and notes in one place
- **Visual appeal** — minimalist design with emojis and icons

**Notion works well for:**
- Personal productivity and small teams (up to 5 people)
- Teams focused primarily on documentation and knowledge bases
- Those who value aesthetics and flexible customization
- Individual content creators and freelancers

### Notion's Limitations for Project Management

Despite its popularity, **Notion has significant limitations as a project management tool:**

**1. No Built-in Time Tracking**

Notion lacks a native time tracker. To track hours, you need third-party integrations (Toggl, Clockify), which complicates budget and cost control for client projects.

**2. No Gantt Charts**

If you need a visual project timeline with task dependencies, Notion doesn't offer this out of the box. You'll need external tools or workarounds.

**3. Limited Reporting**

Notion lacks comprehensive tools for team productivity analysis, plan-vs-actual comparisons, or time-spent reports. You can count tasks, but deep analytics aren't available.

**4. Scalability Issues**

As teams grow or data volume increases, Notion can slow down. Large databases become sluggish, and performance issues emerge at scale.

**5. No Native Workflow Automation**

Setting up automatic task transitions, reminders, or recurring tasks requires third-party integrations like Zapier — adding complexity and cost.

> *"Notion excels at documentation, but for serious project management with time and budget control, you need something else."*

## 5 Reasons Why Worksection Kanban Is Better for Teams

### 1. Time Tracking Out of the Box

**The problem:** Without time tracking, you don't know the real cost of projects. According to our data, **teams lose 3-5 hours per week** due to lack of transparent time accounting.

**Worksection's solution:** The timer is built into every task card. You can see:
- Hours spent on each task
- Whether the team is staying within budget
- Which team members are overloaded

> **"The time tracker helped increase our average service fees. Now we can create transparent reports for clients and justify our costs."**
> — ROMAN.UA, Performance Marketing Agency

**Notion:** Has no built-in time tracking. You need third-party services and manual data synchronization.

### 2. Gantt Chart Integration

**Kanban shows WHAT is being done**, while **Gantt shows WHEN**.

In Worksection, you can switch from Kanban to Gantt chart with one click and see:
- Project timeline
- Task dependencies
- Critical path

**Notion:** Has no Gantt chart. Timeline visualization requires external tools.

### 3. Reporting and Analytics

**Worksection generates automatic reports:**
- Time spent (plan vs. actual)
- By projects and clients
- Team workload distribution
- Overdue tasks

This is critical for **margin control** and **resource planning**.

> **"Through transparent time tracking, we started billing 30% more hours to clients."**
> — Consulting Company

**Notion:** Limited to basic counts (number of tasks, sums). Detailed analytics unavailable.

### 4. Budget Control

In Worksection, you can:
- Set project budget in hours or money
- Track expenses in real time
- Receive alerts when budget is exceeded

**Financial impact:** Companies using Worksection report **40% reduction in budget overruns**.

**Notion:** No budget control functionality.

### 5. More Affordable Pricing

| Plan | Worksection | Notion |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Basic | $2.5/user | $8/user |
| Business | $3.4/user | $15/user |

**For a team of 20 people:**

- Notion: ~$160/month

> **"Worksection saved us $50K per year compared to Asana."**
> — Tech Startup, Operations Director
