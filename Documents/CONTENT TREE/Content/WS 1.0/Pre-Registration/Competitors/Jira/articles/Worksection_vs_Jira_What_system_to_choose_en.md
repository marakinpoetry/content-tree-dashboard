## ​ Who can use Worksection and Jira?

### ​Worksection

####  _​{Worksection might be right for you, in case you are}_

  * **​ A non-technical or hybrid team. **Thanks to its intuitive interface, even specialists without project management experience can work effectively in Worksection. The service is ideal for non-technical and hybrid teams where specialists of different profiles work together: programmers, marketers, sales managers, etc.
  * **Service business.** Timers and reports are the main tools to control the margin of service businesses. Thanks to Worksection hourly rate support, all it takes is a few clicks to start a timer for a specific task and the data is automatically transferred to reports for further analysis.
  * **A team of 10 to 100 people.** The platform is ideal for small and scalable teams. Worksection is able to adapt to the pace of your growth thanks to its versatile project structure: multiple levels of sub-tasks, statuses, tags, etc. 

####  _[You should consider an alternative to Worksection if]_

  * **​​ You have a technical team that requires Agile/DevOps and automation. **However, Worksection focuses on conciseness, which is why it doesn't include multi-level automation and AI integration.
  * **Your requirements include extensive customization options and work with templates.** Compared to other services, Worksection has limited customization functionality and no ready-made templates.

### ​Jira

####  _{Jira is able to increase the potential}_

  * **​ Large enterprises and corporations (100+ people in a team).** Jira is suitable for the organization of many users with complex workflows. You can effectively manage and coordinate the work of many teams and departments thanks to the flexibility and variability of the system structure.
  * **Agile and DevOps teams.** Jira integrates with DevOps tools. This helps automate processes and improve productivity. It also enables teams to adapt to change and respond quickly to new requirements by supporting agile methodologies such as Scrum.
  * **Cross-functional product teams.** Jira tools let you easily track progress, share information, and resolve issues rapidly. The coordination of different areas of work ensures the highest quality of the product.

#### _[You should consider another service if]_

  * ​You're a digital team or the owner of a local clothing brand and **don't need functionality to organize development stages**. Of course, Jira has extensive functionality, but not all teams need it. So, if you are a non-technical team, and you don't see the point of overpaying for features that you are not going to use, you should look at service analogues.
  * **You want a simple and straightforward system** that doesn't require significant team resources for onboarding. For most users, the number of Jira tools is difficult to handle, which makes it hard to get started quickly.

## Why should you choose Worksection?

### ​Reason #1: Hourly rate support

​Worksection is suitable for teams that run client projects and want to
**control their time and money.** The hourly rate format requires
transparency. Worksection provides it with several **key aspects:**

  

![](/images/upload/Worksection_vs_Jira_7_eng.@x1.png)

###### _Work­sec­tion reports and time tracker_

  1. **Structure.** Each client in the system is a separate project, where you can set tasks and split them into two levels of subtasks. In addition, it is possible to set priorities and deadlines, which ensures consistency in work planning.
  2. **Time tracker.** Thanks to the built-in time tracker, you can easily control time by comparing planned indicators with real ones. It helps you to know exactly how much time was spent on each task.
  3. **Reports.** Worksection provides an opportunity to analyze the team's workload and compare it with the results obtained from collaboration. Real-time analytics of project data helps to optimize work and increase its efficiency.

#### ​​As a result, you get:

  * **​​ The actual amount of time spent on the project.** By documenting the resources spent using time tracking tools, you can make informed financial decisions in favor of more profitable projects.
  * **The ability to eliminate unprofitable projects or optimize processes within them.** Analyzing the results of work with the accountability system, you can identify projects that do not bring the expected profit or waste resources.

### ​Reason #2: Price

​We offer a **full set of features** for managing projects of different types
and profiles (Kanban, Gantt chart, reports, timers) at a much lower price. We
charge **from $2.5 instead of $8.15 per user** and don't compromise on
quality.

  

This is an ideal solution for small teams and startups that want to allocate
their financial resources wisely.

### Reason #3: Privacy settings

You can easily customize your work with :

#### [Client]

Add client teams to the system and restrict access to information about people
and individual tasks within the project.

###### _Setting up the visibility of a Worksection task_

####  ​[Team]

​The system allows you to create administrative and user roles with different
permissions.

  

![](/images/upload/Worksection_vs_Jira_9_eng.@x1.png)

​ _Worksection participants' permissions_

  

 _**For example,** an employee with the "user" role can create, comment on,
and view all tasks within an invited project, which is ideal for in-house
staff. At the same time, a person with the "guest" role has access only to
those tasks for which they are an assignee or subscriber, which is ideal for
an outsourced team._

### ​Reason #4: User-friendly implementation

Worksection was designed with the needs of non-technical professionals in
mind. The platform interface **isn't cluttered with unnecessary tools** and
combines functionality with ease of use. This makes it easy to master the
system, even for teams that are just starting to work systematically and
have**no previous experience with project management.**

  

The platform helps focus on core tasks, making the project management process
simple and clear for any user. This approach allows newcomers to online
management services**to quickly understand the settings and create their first
project** without significant complications.

### Reason #5: Caring support

always ready to help**. The support team works seven days a week around the
clock. The average response time**is three minutes,** which allows us to solve
your problems quickly.
