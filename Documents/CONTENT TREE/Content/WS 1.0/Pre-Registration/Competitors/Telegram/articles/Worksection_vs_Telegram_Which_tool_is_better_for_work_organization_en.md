# Worksection vs Telegram: Which tool 
is better for work organization

**Work chats** are a common solution for organizing work. They are used to
document tasks and agreements, communicate with clients and team members,
share files, etc.

  

However, chats are primarily designed as a communication platform, not as a
tool for structuring projects and tasks. For **comprehensive project
management,** there are specialized online services and tools. They have a
full set of features, from task management and status to Gantt charts and time
trackers. That's why chats need to be integrated with these services to
effectively organize workflows.

  

Today, we'll do a **comparison between work chats and project management
tools,** and why they're not interchangeable.

## Briefly about Worksection and Telegram

### [Worksection]

[**Worksection**](https://worksection.com/en/)is a Ukrainian online project
management service founded in **2008** and used by **more than 1,600 teams**
around the world. It provides a comprehensive project management solution with
a built-in task manager, time tracker, Gantt charts, kanban boards, and
detailed reports on team performance.

### Worksection's key capabilities and limitations

#### Capabilities:

  1. **Workflow structuring.** Worksection allows you to divide your business into separate projects, so you don't have to deal with customer payments and milk purchases in the same room. 
  2. **Extensive project and task customization.** Worksection's task manager allows you to create projects, tasks and subtasks, assign a responsible person, set priorities, tags and statuses. Every area of responsibility is under control. 
  3. **Centralized data access.** Worksection helps you collect and organize information within a project or task. Attach files to tasks to automatically store them in the appropriate project with access for the entire team.
  4. **Client communication.** Invite your clients into the project to maintain transparency as you work on the project.
  5. **Manage access to information.** With system permissions and additional privacy settings, you can ensure the confidentiality of information when engaging third parties.

_​ For example, a freelancer with the **" Guest" role **in the system will
only see information on the tasks for which he or she is responsible or a
subscriber.  
  
_

#### Limitations:

  1. **Lack of templates.** Worksection does not provide templates for projects. 
  2. **Low level of customization.** If you are looking for a fully customizable service, you should consider other options. 

#### Rat­ings on catalogs

### [Telegram]

Chats are the main tool for organizing workflows in many companies. They allow
you to **communicate instantly** with team members and customers, sharing
information and files in real time.

### Chats key capabilities and limitations

#### Capabilities:

  1. **Instant information exchange.** Chats provide rapid interaction that allows you to resolve issues quickly. For example, in a crisis situation, team updates happen in seconds. 
  2. **Availability across platforms and devices.** Chats can be used on computers as well as smartphones. For example, Slack and Microsoft Teams have mobile apps that let you stay in touch from anywhere.
  3. **File sharing.** In a chat, you can quickly send a presentation to a client or share a report on your work with colleagues.

#### ​Limitations:

  1. **​ Data overload.** In chat, it's easy to lose an important message or document among hundreds of less important ones.
  2. **Limited ability to organize and structure tasks.** In most chats, it's difficult to create a task hierarchy, set deadlines, and assign responsibilities, making it difficult to track progress and complete tasks.
  3. **Restrictions on managing access to information,** which can lead to privacy issues. 

​ _For example, a new employee may inadvertently**access sensitive
information** if added to a public chat without restrictions._  

_  
_

**The rating on catalogs** depends on the specific service analysis.

## Who can use Worksection and Chats?

### Worksection

####  _{Worksection is right for you if}_

  * **You have a team of 10 to 100 people.** Worksection is ideal for small and medium-sized businesses and provides all the tools you need to organize work.
  * **Looking for a system for structured work.** Worksection has a structure divided into projects with tasks and subtasks of several levels, which helps you control tasks. Adding tags, statuses, and priorities keeps all processes under control and ensures efficiency.
  * **You want to start working on an hourly basis.** Calculate accurate project costs and your profit with Worksection's resource control tools. The time tracker allows you to record the real time of tasks, and automated reporting collects them in one place for easy analytics. 
  * **You need project management tools** such as kanban or Gantt chart. Worksection's kanban board and Gantt chart are one way to visualize your tasks within a project. This simplifies the workflow to two steps: create tasks and display them in the format you require.  
  

#### _[It is better to consider servise alternatives if]_  

  * **​ You are looking for a solution with a high level of automation and templates.** By implementing Worksection, you don't get ready-made templates or access to complex business process automation.
  * **You are not ready to pay for the system.** Worksection is a paid service. If you're not ready to invest in a project management system, it's better to consider free options. 

### ​Chats

####  _{Chats are suitable for you if}_

  * **​ You have a team of up to 5 people with simple line tasks.** Chats will be an effective way to quickly coordinate actions and exchange information for small teams with simple tasks. 
  * **You are looking for a real-time communication solution.** Chats allow you to exchange messages instantly, which helps you respond quickly to changes.
  * **You have a small budget for system implementation.** Messengers like Telegram and WhatsApp have free plans. This makes them affordable for teams with limited finances.

#### _[Chats won't work for you if]_

  * **​ You have complex, multi-level workflows. **Chats may not be functional enough if your projects require complex planning, task distribution, and execution control at different stages.
  * **You need a service with built-in project management tools.** Chats don't have project management tools like kanban boards, Gantt charts, time trackers, etc. For this, it's better to use specialized services. 
  * **You want to centralize all information in one place.** In chats, it is difficult to provide easy access to information for the entire team. Information overload and lack of structure leads to the loss of important data.
  * **You need to communicate transparently with the client based on reporting.** Chats do not provide the proper level of accountability and transparency. Therefore, it is better to use services where you can give clients access to certain parts of the project and reports.

## Task management in Chats and Worksection

As we compare work chats with online project management services, it's
essential to note that **task management via chats is possible.** Let's take a
closer look at the **Telegram messenger.**

### Telegram task management

Telegram offers task management through the **integration of chatbots.** Both
free and paid solutions are available.

#### How does it work?

Chatbots expand chat capabilities with **interactive buttons.** In order to
integrate a chatbot, you need to add it to a working chat. After
authorization, participants will be able to view current and scheduled tasks,
as well as receive new ones.

#### Advantages and disadvantages

**The benefits:**

  1. **You don't waste time on migration,** but stay in a familiar environment without having to switch to another tool.
  2. **Familiar functionality.** Using chatbots simplifies onboarding, as most users are already familiar with how they work.

#### ​Disadvantages:

  1. **​ Lack of structure.** Tasks are still in the chat, and although it's faster to find them with a chatbot, you and your employees don't have a clear hierarchy of tasks with a division into subtasks. 

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### Worksection task management

Task management in Worksection is **available for all plans** and includes the
following features:

  * **Create tasks with two levels of subtasks** for structured work.
  * **Prioritize tasks** to coordinate resources.

  * **Setting deadlines and assigning responsibility.** Basic features for effective time and resource management.

  2. **Communicate within the task.** Use user mentions, attach files directly in the comments to tasks.
  3. **Restrict access** to viewing a task or comments within it. 
  4. **View task history** to track and document all activities.

![](/images/upload/Worksection_vs_Telegram_6_eng.@x1.png)  

Worksection's hourly rate support is based on the coordinated work of the time
tracker and reports:

  * **The timer** allows you to record the time spent on a specific task with a few clicks and automatically display it in reports.
  * **Reports** allow you to analyze the resources used in real time. This allows you to control your margins and avoid loss of profit.

### ​Structured and transparent

#### ​Structuring of processes:

  * ​**A Worksection account is divided into projects.** You can organize separate areas of work in them or assign a project to work with a specific client

  * **Tasks also have labels and statuses.** Statuses are used to mark the stages of the process. Labels are used to indicate their specifics.
  * **Each task has its own person responsible for the result.** All employee activity is reflected in reports.

### ​Transparency of roles and communication

  1. ​**Division into administrative and user roles** to control access to information by employees and stakeholders within the system. For example, a participant with the **" reader"** role can view information about a project, but cannot interact with it. 
  2. **Extensive communication under tasks in the comments.** Each task has its own field for discussion, which allows you to maintain transparency and clarity of the progress.

###### ​You can also hide tasks and contact details of workers from the
client.

### Support during onboarding

Worksection has a **technical support chat** to help you solve any problems in
the process of your onboarding. The key feature of our support is
communication with the system's specialists directly, rather than responding
to template messages from a chatbot.

  

**The technical support chat is available 24/7,** and the average response
time from service experts is **3 minutes.** You will also have access to
information in the system's blog, FAQs with a detailed description of the
functionality, and short tutorial videos on YouTube.
