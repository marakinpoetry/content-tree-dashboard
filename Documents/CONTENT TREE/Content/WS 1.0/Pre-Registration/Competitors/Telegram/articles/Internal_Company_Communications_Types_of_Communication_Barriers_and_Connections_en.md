# Internal Company Communications:
Types of Communication, Barriers,
and Connections

**Communications within an organization serve at least two inseparable
purposes.** On one hand, without comfortable interaction, it is impossible to
create a harmonious internal team environment. On the other hand, without
exchanging information about work processes, tasks simply won't align.
Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider various types and means of
communication within companies.

  

![](/images/upload/Sommunication_2.@x1_3.png)  

## What is the communicative process?

Communication plays an invaluable role in the operation of any enterprise.
Communication within an organization is a mandatory condition for various
aspects of work, including:

  1. **Goal and Task Setting:** Enables employees to understand expectations and work harmoniously to achieve common objectives.
  2. **Exchange of Information and Ideas:** Facilitates making informed and effective decisions.
  3. **Task Implementation,** Coordination of Actions, Problem-Solving: Achieving results through the process of communication.
  4. **Open and Honest Communication:** Motivates employees, creating an atmosphere of trust and support.
  5. **Building Strong Relationships** and a Sense of a Unified Team: Communication in the organization helps foster strong relationships and a sense of a cohesive team.​

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

To ensure that all communication functions are fulfilled, the communication
structure must be well-coordinated, free of obstacles, and include all
necessary components.

### Communication Structure

The transactional model of communication is the most logical, consisting of
sequential stages:

  

![](/images/upload/Sommunication_3.@x1_2.png)  

This is simple yet effective model succinctly describes the components of the
communication process:

  * **Sender:** The individual or group generating an idea or information and transmitting it. The sender must formulate their thoughts and choose an appropriate channel for transmission.
  * **Communication Channel:** The means through which the message is sent. It can be verbal (oral, written language) or non-verbal (gestures, reports, sketches). The channel should be relevant to the target audience and the content of the message.
  * **Message:** The information transmitted from the sender to the receiver. Messages can include news, tasks, orders, questions, etc., but it is crucial for them to be understandable to the receiver.
  * **Recipient:** The person or group receiving the message. Similar to the sender, the recipient can be an individual or a group. The recipient must receive and correctly understand the message.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

In addition to these fundamental elements, the information exchange process
may involve **additional factors** :

  * **Feedback:** The receiver's response to clarify or confirm their understanding of the message.
  * **Barriers:** Any obstacles that may distort the message (e.g., noise in the room, lack of communication, or errors in data transmission).

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## Communication Barriers

**Communication barriers in a company are** obstacles that hinder effective
exchange of information and ideas. Anything can be a barrier, ranging from
objective to purely subjective reasons.

  

![](/images/upload/Sommunication_4.@x1_4.png)  

Let's discuss some common reasons complicating communication within an
organization:

  1. **Physical Barriers:** Such as noise, poor visibility, or significant distances.
  2. **Psychological Barriers:** Such as fear of management, uncertainty in decision-making, or misunderstandings due to different experiences.
  3. **Semantic Barriers: I** ncluding differences in terminology, misleading formulations, or the use of slang.
  4. **Organizational Barriers:** Complex hierarchies impeding communication, bureaucratic processes complicating interaction.
  5. **Information Gaps:** If team members lack necessary information for effective exchange.
  6. **Technical Barriers:** Absence or inconvenience of communication tools within the organization.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

To overcome or avoid creating barriers in workplace communication, it is
necessary to foster an atmosphere of trust and openness within the team and
utilize **appropriate communication types.**

## Types of Communication in Organizations

**The types of communication based on** the relationships between participants
are prerequisites for effective message exchange without unnecessary
obstacles.

  

Different types of communication may be used in one company depending on the
number of employees, team composition, ongoing projects, and other
circumstances. Each type of communication plays its crucial role in
organizational communication. Therefore, understanding **various communication
types and their characteristics is beneficial.**

### {Vertical Communication}

**Communication between management and subordinates.** Can flow both top-down
(e.g., task assignments) and bottom-up (e.g., reports from subordinates to
management).

  

![](/images/upload/Sommunication_5.@x1_3.png)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### {Horizontal Communication}

**Communication between colleagues on the same level.** Essential for
collaboration, coordination of actions, and synchronization of work processes
between different teams.

  

![](/images/upload/Sommunication_6.@x1_2.png)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### {External Communication}

**Communication with clients, partners, investors,** and other external
stakeholders.

  

![](/images/upload/Sommunication_7.@x1_2.png)

### {Diagonal Communication}

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Communication where employees from different departments and hierarchy levels
**can communicate directly** without involving managers or other
"intermediary" links.

  

![](/images/upload/Sommunication_8.@x1_2.png)  

Well-selected, configured, and applied types of communication in a
company**enhance the speed and efficiency** of information exchange, improve
connections between different departments and employee engagement levels. They
also contribute to innovation and overall company development.

  

However, errors in communication settings can lead to **" information noise"**
and information overload, creating confusion and ambiguity. To avoid such
complications and achieve communication efficiency, **it is necessary to:**

  * Establish rules and communication procedures in the company.
  * Train employees.
  * Provide the necessary infrastructure for communication tools.​​

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## Means of Communication Within a Company

Communication tools in an organization can be conventionally divided into two
categories:

#### [Synchronous]

  * **Instant Messaging** (WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, etc.).
  * **Phone Calls**(mobile, landline).
  * **Video Calls**(visual contact as an advantage).
  * **Web Conferences**(provide shared access to screens, presentations, chat, and other functions).
  * **Meetings and Conferences**(various numbers of people can meet in person or online).

#### ​[Asynchronous]

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

  * **Email** (text messages, files, and other information stored until deleted).
  * **Project Management Systems** (aid in planning, organizing, and tracking tasks and goals).
  * **Internal Forums** (communication and information exchange strictly within the organization).
  * **Social Networks**(can be used for personal and business communication).
  * **Surveys** (data collection for research, feedback, etc.).​

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Chatbots and notification systems can belong to both categories of
communication tools. All of them can be used in various combinations for the
convenience of teams. The diversity of communication tools in an organization
promotes **efficient information exchange.** However, in practice, some
communication tools are more prevalent than others, such as messengers and
work calls.

## Messengers in Workplace Communication

Most companies use messengers for communication among colleagues. It is indeed
a convenient and familiar means of communication that has seamlessly
integrated into everyday life. However, it's essential to consider that
**messengers were not specifically designed for work communication,** so their
use has both advantages and disadvantages.

  

![](https://worksection.com/images/upload/Sommunication_8_1.@x1.png)

  

### Advantages of Messengers in Team Communication:

  * **Mobility:** Messengers are available on mobile devices, allowing employees to stay connected anytime, anywhere.
  * **Operational:** The ability to send and receive messages and responses in real-time.
  * **Simplicity:** Messengers are user-friendly, familiar to all employees, and do not require special training.
  * **Team Collaboration:** Group chats can be created for communication within the entire team or specific departments.
  * **Materials:** The ability to send files in various formats, exchange documents, images, media.​

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### ​​Disadvantages of Messengers:

  * **Unstructured Data:** Information in messengers arrives and is stored chronologically, making it challenging to search and utilize.
  * **Lack of Context and Details:** Messengers can be inconvenient for tracking task progress due to the absence of context.
  * **Information Overload:** Employees may receive too many work and personal messages across different messengers, diverting attention and consuming time.
  * **Security:** Most messengers do not provide a sufficient level of security, making them unsuitable for discussing confidential matters.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Using messengers for work communication is possible,** taking into account
their pros and cons. It's crucial to clearly define rules for using messengers
in the company, train employees, and ensure the necessary communication tools
infrastructure.

## Work Calls: Pros and Cons

**Work calls are** traditionally a popular tool for work communication, and
they have certain advantages and disadvantages.

  

![](/images/upload/Sommunication_8.@x1_3.png)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### Advantages of Work Calls:

  * **Personal Interaction:** The voice and intonation of the interlocutor make communication more meaningful.
  * **Promptness:** The ability to quickly get answers to questions or immediately clarify details.
  * **Involvement of Multiple Participants:** In group discussions via video calls.​

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### Disadvantages of Work Calls:

  * **Time Consumption:** Calls can take up a significant amount of time, especially with many participants.
  * **Data Fixation:** Information discussed over the phone or through video calls is harder to document and apply in work.
  * **Technical Issues:** Calls may be interrupted due to communication glitches.
  * **Distraction:** Calls demand full attention, making it impossible to multitask, such as during email correspondence.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

If a workday is overloaded with calls, work efficiency decreases, and
individuals can quickly become fatigued from the volume of contacts and
information. **Therefore, it's advisable to use work communication
selectively, only when truly appropriate.**

### When is Communication through Work Calls Appropriate?

Calls bring the most benefit to team communication when used in **moderation
and when truly needed:**

  1. **Urgent Matters:** For discussing urgent issues in real-time.
  2. **Complex Problem-Solving:** To address intricate problems requiring simultaneous involvement of team members.
  3. **Personal Interaction:** Between managers, HR, and employees.
  4. **Scheduled Online Team Meetings:** For regular planned team or department meetings.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

To avoid overloading schedules with calls, clearly define their **content and
purpose, communicate concisely, and adhere to timing.** Following these simple
communication rules can make interactions within the company effective and
meaningful.

## Why is Meaningful Communication Important?

**Meaningful communication is** consciously directed communication aimed at
achieving a specific goal. The meaningfulness of communication can be
determined by:

  

![](/images/upload/Communication_11_var1.@x1_4.png)  

  * Clarity and Unambiguity of Messages.
  * Conciseness.
  * Completeness and Inclusion of All Necessary Information.
  * Relevance to the Conversation Topic.
  * Politeness and Correctness.​​

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

#### The importance of meaningful communication cannot be overstated for
several reasons:

  1. **Improves Work Efficiency:** Clear and concise communication enables people to perform their tasks faster and better.
  2. **Enhances Relationships:** Meaningful communication contributes to understanding among individuals and team building.
  3. **Facilitates Innovation:** Increased sharing of ideas and information leads to the generation of new ideas and solutions.
  4. **Reduces Error Risks:** Clear communication helps avoid misunderstandings and errors.
  5. **Increases Job Satisfaction:** People are more satisfied with their work when they feel heard and understood.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

However, all these advantages can be neutralized by several factors **that
hinder meaningful communication.**

### What prevents companies from building meaningful communication

The exchange of information in the organization will not be meaningful if
there are one or more obstacles:

  * **Lack of openness and trust culture.** If employees don't feel comfortable talking about their ideas and problems, effective communication is impossible.
  * **Unclear communication:** If management does not set clear goals and objectives, employees will not know what is expected of them.
  * **Bureaucracy.** Complex procedures and strict formalities hinder effective and meaningful communication.
  * **Technological disadvantages.** Useful tools are necessary for meaningful communication.

## Improving Communication in the Organization

​​The communication process is a flexible and adaptive information exchange
system that can and should be improved. To build quality and meaningful
communication, **companies should, at a minimum:**

**  
**

**

  1. **Create a Culture of Openness and Trust:** Establish practices for information exchange in the work process.
  2. **Ensure Clear Communication Standards:** Specify task formats and response times.
  3. **Develop Effective Communication Skills:** Train both leaders and subordinates.
  4. **Provide Convenient Communication Tools f** or Employees.

**​**

**Communications meeting these conditions benefit both business processes and
the team atmosphere.** However, continual monitoring of communication quality
and regular reviews of communication tools' relevance in your company are
essential.

## Transition to More Informative Messaging

Communication tools in the organization are constantly being improved in
response to the needs of users. Therefore, both traditional and innovative
communication tools are currently available, among which **each team chooses
the most convenient combination of communication tools. These include:**

  * Messengers
  * Phone Calls
  * Video Conferences
  * Internal Forums and Chats
  * Notification Systems
  * Internet Platforms
  * Surveys
  * Project Management Systems

​​​​​​​​

The choice of specific tools and their quantity depends on the company's size,
its projects, and the components of effective communication suitable for your
team.
