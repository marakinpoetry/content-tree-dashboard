## BLOCK 1: INTRODUCTION
**[0:00 - 0:30]**
**[Visual: Speaker on camera, neutral background]**

---

Hi there!

[pause]

My name is [Name], and I'm a manager at Worksection.

Today I'll show you how to **quickly get started** with the new version of the system.

[pause]

In just five minutes, you'll learn how to:

create projects,
add tasks,
invite your team,
and set up your profile.

[pause]

It's all pretty simple. Let's dive in!

---

## BLOCK 2: CREATING A PROJECT
**[0:30 - 1:45]**
**[Visual: Screen recording, speaker in circle overlay bottom right]**

---

When you signed up, the system automatically created a **demo project** for you.

It's a practice project where you can click around and see how things work.

[pause]

But now, let's create **your first real project**.

[pause]

See this green **plus button** at the top?

Click it.

And select **"New Project"**.

[pause]

Now let's fill in the details.

**Name** — write something clear for your team.

For example, "Website Redesign" or "Marketing Campaign".

[pause]

**Description** — briefly, what this project is about.

This helps your colleagues understand the context.

[pause]

Next — the **deadline**.

If your project has an end date — enter it here.

If it's ongoing work with no deadline — just skip this.

[pause]

**Project Manager** — this is the person responsible for this project.

By default, it's you, but you can change it.

[pause]

And lastly — **task statuses**.

These are the stages your tasks go through.

For example: "In Progress", "In Review", "Done".

You can keep the defaults or customize them.

[pause]

That's it! Click **"Create"**.

[pause]

The project is ready. But it's empty for now.

Let's add some tasks.

---

## BLOCK 3: CREATING TASKS
**[1:45 - 3:00]**
**[Visual: Screen recording, speaker in circle]**

---

Tasks are the specific things that need to be done in a project.

[pause]

To create a task, click the **green plus** again.

And select **"New Task"**.

[pause]

Fill in the **title**.

Be specific, so it's clear what needs to be done.

For example: "Prepare homepage mockup".

[pause]

In the **description**, you can add details.

What exactly needs to be done, requirements, things to keep in mind.

[pause]

Now, this is important — the **deadline**.

Without a deadline, the task won't appear in reports and the person won't get reminders.

So it's better to always set a date.

[pause]

**Priority** — how urgent is this?

There's normal, high, and urgent.

[pause]

**Status** — what stage is the task at right now?

For example, "New" or "In Progress".

[pause]

You can also **attach a file** — a mockup, document, whatever you need.

[pause]

Done! Click **"Create"**.

[pause]

First task is ready.

[pause]

Now let me show you a **quick way** to create several tasks at once.

[pause]

Click plus again, but select **"Group of Tasks"**.

Here you can type several titles — each on a new line.

And set deadlines.

[pause]

See? In just a few seconds, we created three tasks.

[pause]

Now we have a project with tasks.

But who's going to do them?

We need to invite the team.

---

## BLOCK 4: INVITING YOUR TEAM
**[3:00 - 4:00]**
**[Visual: Screen recording, speaker in circle]**

---

Let's go to the **"People"** page.

It's in the menu on the left.

[pause]

Here you can see your company structure.

Right now, it's just you.

[pause]

To invite colleagues, click **"Invite"**.

[pause]

Enter the person's **email**.

They'll receive an invitation and can join.

[pause]

Important thing — the **role**.

I recommend starting with the **"User"** role.

That's basic permissions — see their tasks, comment, track time.

[pause]

Later you can give more permissions to team leads or managers.

[pause]

Let's invite a few more people.

[pause]

Done. Now we wait for them to accept the invitation.

[pause]

Meanwhile, let's go back to our tasks and **assign responsible people**.

[pause]

Open a task.

Here's the **"Assignee"** field.

Click and select a person from the list.

[pause]

That person will get a notification and see the task in their list.

[pause]

Do the same for other tasks.

[pause]

Now everyone knows what they need to do.

---

## BLOCK 5: PROFILE SETTINGS
**[4:00 - 4:45]**
**[Visual: Screen recording, speaker in circle]**

---

Last step — set up your profile.

This is important so your colleagues can recognize you.

[pause]

Click on your name in the top right corner.

And go to **"Profile Settings"**.

[pause]

First — your **photo**.

Upload a proper photo where people can see you.

It helps the team quickly figure out who's who.

[pause]

Next — your **job title**.

Write what you do in the company.

For example, "Project Manager" or "Designer".

[pause]

And here's something really useful — **work schedule**.

[pause]

Here you can set which days and hours you work.

And also add vacations or days off.

[pause]

This helps the system calculate workload correctly.

And colleagues can see when you're unavailable.

[pause]

Save — and you're done!

---

## BLOCK 6: CLOSING
**[4:45 - 5:10]**
**[Visual: Speaker on camera]**

---

That's it!

[pause]

In five minutes, we:

created a project,
added tasks,
invited the team,
assigned responsible people,
and set up our profile.

[pause]

Now you're ready to work in Worksection.

[pause]

If you have any questions — write to our support chat.

We're available **24/7** and respond within minutes.

[pause]

Have a productive day!

And see you in the next videos.
