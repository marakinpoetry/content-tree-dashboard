### 1️⃣ DM ДЛЯ HUNTERS

*Людина з Product Hunt комьюніті, яка має багато підписників і може опублікувати продукт на платформі.* 

**\[Варіант 1\]**

Subject: Quick question about Product Hunt

Hi \[Name\],

I noticed you hunted \[Product X\] back in \[Month\] — congrats on the success\!

We're launching Worksection 2.0 on Product Hunt on \[Date\], and I think it might resonate with your community.

Quick context: We rebuilt our project management tool from scratch to solve the \#1 frustration — PM tools that slow teams down instead of speeding them up.

Would you be open to checking it out? If it resonates, we'd be honored if you'd consider hunting it.

No pressure either way — happy to answer any questions.

Best,
