### ГОТОВІ ПРИКЛАДИ TESTIMONIALS

* **Speed & Performance**

1. Everything in Worksection 2.0 happens instantly. Creating tasks, switching projects, finding files — it's all milliseconds. After using clunky PM tools for years, this feels like a breath of fresh air.  
2. I timed it. Creating a task in our old tool: 45 seconds. In Worksection 2.0? 8 seconds. Multiply that by 50 tasks a day, and you see why we switched.

* **Ease of Use**

1. We onboarded 12 new team members last month. With our old PM tool, training took days. With Worksection 2.0? Everyone was productive within an hour. The interface just makes sense.  
2. No manual. No training videos. I just opened Worksection 2.0 and started working. That's how intuitive it is."

* **Team Collaboration**

1. Before Worksection 2.0, our team updates were scattered across Slack, email, and Google Docs. Now everything lives in one place. We cut meeting time by 40%.  
2. Real-time updates mean I always know what my team is working on — no need to ping people for status checks. It's collaboration without interruption.

* **Migration Success**

1. We hesitated to switch from \[Tool X\] because migration is always a nightmare. Worksection's team handled everything — moved our 40+ projects in 3 days. Easiest tool switch we've ever done.

* **Business Results**

1. Since switching to Worksection 2.0, we're completing projects 20% faster. The time saved on admin tasks alone pays for the subscription 3x over.
