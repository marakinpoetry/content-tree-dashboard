## MAIN DESCRIPTION (Product Hunt Post)

### \[V.1\] — \~400 слів description

Why we rebuilt Worksection from the ground up **🚀**

After 15 years of building project management software, we realized something painful:  
most PM tools punish you for moving fast. They're bloated, slow, and make you click  
10 times to do 1 thing.

So we started fresh.

What makes Worksection 2.0 different: 

**🚀 Speed that matters**  
Everything loads instantly. Creating tasks, switching projects, finding files — it all happens in milliseconds, not seconds.

**🎯 Clarity by design**  
No clutter. No confusing menus. Just clean dashboards that show exactly what you need, when you need it.

**⚡ Built for real teams**  
Whether you're 5 people or 500, Worksection scales without slowing down.  
Fast onboarding, zero learning curve.

**Perfect for teams who:**

* Ship fast and can't afford tool drag  
* Need clarity without complexity  
* Want their PM tool to keep up, not hold them back  
* Are tired of enterprise bloat or freemium limitations

**What's inside:**  
✅ Lightning-fast task management  
✅ Visual project timelines (Gantt made easy)  
✅ Time tracking built-in  
✅ Team workload balancing  
✅ Built-in messenger  
✅ File management that doesn't suck  
✅ Mobile apps (iOS \+ Android)  
✅ Integrations with tools you already use  
✅ Migration support from any PM tool

**Coming soon:**  
🤖 AI assistant for smart task suggestions  
⚙️ Advanced automations  
📊 Predictive analytics

**Product Hunt Exclusive Offers:**

🎁 20% off annual plans (first 5 days) — Code: PRODUCTHUNT20

### \[V.3\] — Ukrainian angle

Made in Ukraine 🇺🇦Rebuilt during war. Built for teams who refuse to settle.

When war started in 2022, we had a choice: pause development or keep building.

We chose to rebuild everything.

For 4 years, while facing daily air raid sirens, our team threw away a decade of code and reimagined what project management should feel like. 

**Why rebuild from scratch?**

Because we saw teams waste 30+ minutes daily just waiting — waiting for tasks to load, waiting for pages to refresh, waiting for context switches between tools.

Most PM tools are optimized to look good on demos. We optimized for the 50+ times per day you actually use them.

**What we built:**

**⚡ Speed you can feel**

* Task opens in 0.3s (vs typical \~1s)  
* Multiply by 50 daily opens \= 30 minutes saved per person, per day  
* Just from not waiting for interfaces to load

**💬 Zero context switching**

* Built-in messenger inside every task  
* No more “let me check Slack” x 47 times a day  
* Discussions live where work happens

**📈 Scales without breaking**

* Works for 5-person teams and 500-person companies  
* Same simplicity, same speed, same price structure  
* No “contact sales for enterprise” when you grow

**🎨 Completely refreshed interface**

* Modern Kanban, Gantt, Table views  
* Dark mode that actually works  
* Designed for 8+ hour workdays, not 5-minute demos

**Try it yourself:**

* Free migration from any PM tool (we'll do it for you)  
* 20% off first year for Product Hunt community  
* Early access to AI features (coming Q1 2025\)

Built with ❤️ in Ukraine 🇺🇦

### \[V.4\] — Problem-First 

Project management tools make you wait. Worksection 2.0 makes you fast.

Here's what nobody talks about with PM tools:

The micro-frustrations that add up. The 1-second load times. The tab-switching to check messages. The “which plan do we need now that we're 51 people?” conversations.

Individually? Annoying but tolerable.  
 Daily? 30+ minutes of pure waiting time per person.

We spent 4 years rebuilding Worksection from scratch to eliminate exactly that.

**Built differently:**

**⚡ 0.3-second task opening**  
 Not “fast enough.” Actually instant.

Open a task 50 times a day? That's 30 minutes you're NOT spending watching loading spinners. Per person. Per day.

**💬 Built-in messenger**  
Discussions happen inside tasks. Not in Slack. Not in email. Right where the work is.

No more:

* “Wait, where did we discuss this?”  
* “Let me find that Slack thread…”  
* 47 context switches per day between tools

**📈 Scales without drama**  
5-person startup or 500-person company — same tool, same simplicity, same pricing model.

No “contact sales” when you hit an arbitrary team size limit.

**🎨 Interface rebuilt from zero**

* Modern Kanban with drag-and-drop that feels right  
* Gantt charts that don't make you cry  
* Dark mode designed for 8-hour workdays  
* Mobile app that's actually usable

**For Product Hunt community:**

* 20% off first year  
* Free migration from any PM tool (we handle it)  
* Early AI access (launching Q1 2025\)

Try it. Break it. Tell us what's wrong. We're here to learn 🇺🇦

## MAKER'S COMMENT (First Comment)

### \[V.1\] — професійний, структурований 

Hey Product Hunt\! 👋

I'm \[Name\], \[Role\] at Worksection, and I'm pumped to share what we've been  
building for the past 4 years.

**The backstory**

More than 15 years ago, we launched Worksection. It helped thousands of teams ship projects faster. But as our users grew, we noticed a pattern: the more successful they became, the more their tools slowed them down.

Clicking through 5 menus to assign a task. Waiting 3 seconds for a page to load. Hunting through cluttered dashboards to find what matters.

That's not how modern teams work. So we made a call: rebuild from scratch.

**What we did differently**

* **Speed first.** We obsessed over every millisecond. The result? Everything —  
  tasks, projects, files — loads instantly.  
* **Clarity over features.** We cut the bloat. No confusing menus. No enterprise  
  jargon. Just what you actually need to ship.  
* **Built to scale.** Whether you're 5 people or 500, Worksection 2.0 keeps up.  
* **Fast onboarding.** Zero learning curve.

**Why we're here**

We want feedback from people who actually use PM tools every day. This community built some of the tools we admire most. Now it's our turn to hear what you think.

**What we're offering PH community:**

🎯 20% off annual plans (first 5 days)  
📞 Free migration support (we'll move your projects for you)  
🧪 Priority access to AI features (launching Q1 2026\)

Let's talk 💬 

Try it. Break it. Tell us what sucks. I'll be here all day replying to every comment because your feedback matters.

Thanks for checking us out 🚀

P.S. If you're moving from another tool, I've got migration tips. Just ask 👇

### \[V.2\] — з Vulnerability (рекомендований Claude) 

Hey Product Hunt\! 👋

I'm \[Name\], founder of Worksection. And honestly? I'm terrified.

We just spent the last 4 years rebuilding our entire product from scratch. Threw away a decade of code. Told our \[Х+\] users "trust us — the new version will be worth it."

What if we're wrong?

But here's why we did it anyway...

**The Breaking Point**

We launched Worksection over 15 years ago in Ukraine. Thousands of teams used it to ship projects faster. We were proud.

But then we started seeing a pattern:

→ "Love Worksection, but switching to \[competitor\] because it's faster"  
→ "Can you make task creation simpler? Takes too many clicks"  
→ "Why does the dashboard take 3 seconds to load?"

Our most successful users were leaving because the tool that helped them grow couldn't keep up with their speed.

That hurt.

We had two choices:  
1\. Keep patching an aging codebase  
2\. Start over and build what PM tools should be in 2025

We chose the hard path.

**What We Did Differently**

* Obsessed over speed.

Not "kinda fast." Actually fast. We benchmarked every interaction:

- Dashboard loads: 200ms average (old version: 2.8s)  
- Task creation: 2 clicks (old version: 7-10 clicks)  
- Project switching: instant (old version: loading spinner)

* Cut the bloat.

We removed 40% of old features. Yes, really. If a feature didn't help teams ship faster, it's gone. Some users will hate this. That's okay.

* Made it feel obvious.

Zero learning curve was the goal. Your team should be productive in 30 minutes, not 3 days.

**What I'm Worried About**

Let me be honest about what keeps me up at night:

1\. Did we make it TOO fast?\*\* Some beta users said they miss seeing progress indicators because things happen so instantly it feels "unnatural" 😅  
2\. Did we cut too much? We removed features 15% of users loved to make the experience better for 85%. Were we right?  
3\. Can we compete? PM tools market is crowded. Monday, Asana, ClickUp all have massive budgets. We're a bootstrapped Ukrainian team trying to out-execute giants.

**What I'm Excited About**

Despite the fear, here's why I think we got this right:

→ Our beta users (Classic → 2.0 migrators) report 30% faster project completion on average  
→ Support tickets dropped 60% because things "just make sense now"  
→ Teams that tried us vs. Monday/Asana stick with us 8/10 times  
→ We're proving you don't need VC millions to build world-class software from Ukraine 🇺🇦

**What We're Offering This Community**

* 20% off annual plans (first 5 days) — Code: PRODUCTHUNT20  
* Free migration\*\* from ANY PM tool — we'll do it for you  
* Priority AI access — first 100 signups get early access to our  
* AI assistant (launching Q1 2026\)

**Let's Talk**

Here's what I need from you:

1\. Try it. Seriously, just click around for 5 minutes. Create a task, drag it around, feel the speed.

2\. Be brutal. If something sucks, tell me. "Nice launch\!" comments are kind, but "this feature is confusing" comments make us better.

3\. Compare it. Using Monday? Asana? ClickUp? I want to know:

* What does Worksection do better?  
* What did we miss?  
* Would you actually switch? Why / why not?

I'll be here ALL DAY answering every single comment. Technical questions, business questions, "why are Ukrainian startups crushing it right now" questions — anything.

We rebuilt this for you. Now tell us if we got it right.

### \[V.3\] — з Vulnerability (Shorter Version) 

Hey Product Hunt\! 👋

Honest moment: I'm nervous.

We just rebuilt Worksection from scratch after 15 years. Deleted all the old code. Told our users "trust us, 2.0 will be better."

Big risk. But here's why we did it.

**Why We Started Over**

Our users were outgrowing us. Fast-moving teams said: "Love it, but switching to \[tool\] — it's faster".

That stung. So we rebuilt. Not "improved" — REBUILT.

**What We Did Differently**

⚡ Made it fast

* Task opens: 0.3 s (earlier \~1s)  
* Dashboard loads: 200 ms average  
* No loading spinners anywhere

We timed everything. Worksection 2.0 is 3x faster than tools you're using now.

🚀 Built it to scale

* Same speed with 5 or 500 people  
* No "upgrade for performance" BS  
* Flexible workflows that adapt to YOUR process

💬 Added built-in messenger

* Stop switching between Slack and your PM tool  
* Discuss tasks where the work happens  
* Turn conversations into tasks (one click)

🎨 Redesigned everything

* Removed 40% of bloat  
* Clean, modern interface  
* Onboard new teammates in 30 minutes (was 2-3 days)

**What I'm Worried About**

Real talk:

* Did we make it TOO fast? (beta users miss loading spinners 😅)  
* Did we cut too much? (removed 40% of features)  
* Can a Ukrainian team compete with VC-backed giants?

**What I Need From You**

1\. Try it (5 minutes, just feel the speed)  
2\. Be brutal (what sucks? tell me)  
3\. Compare (better than your current tool? worse? why?)

I'm here all day. Every comment gets a reply.

🎁 Product Hunt exclusive:

* 20% off (PRODUCTHUNT20)  
* Free migration from any tool  
* Early AI access (first 100\)

Let's do this.

## COMMENT RESPONSE TEMPLATES

* **How is this different from \[Tool X\]?**

The main difference is speed and simplicity. While \[Tool X\] is powerful, it often requires multiple clicks and learning curves. We rebuilt Worksection to make common actions (creating tasks, assigning people, tracking time) instant. Plus, we're offering PH users 20% off \+ free migration if you want to try switching. Want me to walk you through the key differences?

* **What's your pricing?**

We keep it simple: $X/user/month (billed annually) or $Y/user/month (monthly). For Product Hunt community, we're offering 20% off annual plans for the first 5 days (code: PRODUCTHUNT20). Plus, free migration support if you're switching from another tool. Want to try it? First 14 days are free, no credit card needed.

* **This looks great\!**

Thank you\! That means a lot. If you try it out, I'd love to hear what you think — good, bad, or ugly. And if you run into any issues, tag me here or email \[email\]. We're here to help 🙌

* **Missing \[important feature\]**

Great callout. \[Feature X\] isn't live yet, but it's on our roadmap for \[timeframe\]. We're prioritizing based on user feedback, so this helps. Can you tell me more about your use case? That'll help us prioritize. Also, upvoting this gets you early access when it launches.
